### Transcription Factor
- Protein that regulate the rate of expression of the gene by binding to DNA.

### The Operon for Negative Control
- A segment of DNA made up of a promoter, an operator, and a cluster of genes
- Operon expression is controlled by the operator
- Negative Control involves the regulation of a repressor protein
- Repression: A process by which the transcription of an enzyme's gene is inhibited when its substrate is in excess
- Induction: Process by which the transcription of an enzyme's gene is activated in response to an excess of its substrate
