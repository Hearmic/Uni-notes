### Transcription Factor
- Protein that regulate the rate of expression of the gene by binding to DNA.

### The Operon for Negative Control
- A segment of DNA made up of a promoter, an operator, and a cluster of genes
- Operon expression is controlled by the operator
- Negative Control involves the regulation of a repressor protein
- Repression: A process by which the transcription of an enzyme's gene is inhibited when its substrate is in excess
- Induction: Process by which the transcription of an enzyme's gene is activated in response to an excess of its substrate


## Negative Control
### Repression
- Arginine acts as a corepressor that binds to the repressor of the arginine gene, thereby the number of arginine synthesizing enzyme is regulated
### Induction (removing repressor)
- When an excess of lactose is present, it binds to LacI repressor, which is then released from the DNA, thereby activating the synthesis of $\beta$-Galactosidase for lactose breakdown. In that case, lactose acts as an inducer (allolactose)

## Positive Control
### Induction (activator)
- maltose as a Inducer bind to the MalT activator protein, which changes the conformation of the activator and binds to the operon, recruiting RNA polymerase, and transcription proceeds.

## Activator Binding Site and Promoter
- Both might be far apart; in that case, the DNA remodeling protein bend DNA so the activator can interact with the RNA polymerase which bind to promoter sequence.

### Operon: Promoter + Additional sequences
