### MHC-II pathway of antigen processing
- Uptake of extracellular proteins into vesicular compartments of APC
- Processing of internalized proteins in endosomal/lysosomal vesicles
- Biosynthesis and transport of class II MHC molecules to endosomes
- Association of processed peptides with class II MHC molecules in vesicles
- Expression of peptide-MHC complexes on the cell surface

- Extracellular antigens from pathogens (bacteria or parasites) -> taken up by APCs -> Lysosomes -> acidified peptides

### MHC-I pathway of antigen processing
Intracellular antigens form pathogens
- Production of proteins in or delivery to the cytosol 
- Proteolytic degradation of proteins
- Peptide transport from cytosol to ER 
- Assembly of peptide-class I complexes in ER
- Surface expression of peptide-class I complexes

APCs such as DC express both MHC1 and MHC2 molecules
If they are infected -> they will present antigens in MHCI molecules
If they phagocytose -> they will present the antigen to T cells
If they present on MHCII -> activate T helper cells
If they present on MHCI -> activate Cytotoxic T cells
### Cross-presentation of Ag to CD8+ T Cells
- Some DCs in the lymph node present endocytosed antigens on MHCI to native CD8+ T Cell

### Phagocytosis
- Neutrophils & Macrophages phagocytose microbes -> destroy ingested microbes in intracellular vesicles
1. They have phagocytic receptors on their surface that bind to the microbe (PRRs, FcR, MBL, & CR)
2. Opsonized microbes (coated with antibodies or complement) bind avidly -> enhanced phagocytosis
3. Extension of the phagocyte's plasma membrane around the microbe or particle
4. Internalization of the microbe into endosomes (membrane closes up and pinches off) -> a membrane-bound vesicle. -> phagosome
5. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes (Acidic) -> phagolysosomes
6. Microbes are killed by various 

### B and T cell development
After birth,
Lymphocytes are generated in central or primary Lymphoid organs (Bone marrow & Thymus)
- B Cell -> Bone marrow -> Spleen
- T Cell -> Bone marrow -> thymus

### A series of events occurs in the primary lymphoid organs
- Commitment of progenitor cells
- Proliferation
- The sequential and ordered rearrangement of antigen receptor genes
- Selection events that preserve cells that have produced functional antigen receptor proteins and eliminate potentially dangerous cells that strongly recognize self-antigens.
- Differentiation of B and T cells into functionally and phenotypically distinct subpopulations.
