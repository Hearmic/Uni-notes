### MHC-II pathway of antigen processing
- Uptake of extracellular proteins into vesicular compartments of APC
- Processing of internalized proteins in endosomal/lysosomal vesicles
- Biosynthesis and transport of class II MHC molecules to endosomes
- Association of processed peptides with class II MHC molecules in vesicles
- Expression of peptide-MHC complexes on the cell surface

- Extracellular antigens from pathogens (bacteria or parasites) -> taken up by APCs -> Lysosomes -> acidified peptides

### MHC-I pathway of antigen processing
Intracellular antigens form pathogens
- Production of proteins in or delivery to the cytosol 
- Proteolytic degradation of proteins
- Peptide transport from cytosol to ER 
- Assembly of peptide-class I complexes in ER
- Surface expression of peptide-class I complexes

APCs such as DC express both MHC1 and MHC2 molecules
If they are infected -> they will present antigens in MHCI molecules
If they phagocytose -> they will present the antigen to T cells
If they present on MHCII -> activate T helper cells
If they present on MHCI ->
