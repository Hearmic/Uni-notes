### Module 1: Immune system introduction, components, their development and distribution

Module 2: 
Module 3: Immune memory, Vaccines, Vaccine developments (March 12th - March 19)
Module 4: Immune disorders, Immunotherapies, Introduction to research methods (March 24th - April 2nd)

All immune cells are originated from bone marrow

Lymph Node, Thymus, 

Innate Immune System: Natural Killer Cell
Adaptive Immune System: T Cell, B Cell

Immunity: protection from disease and, more specifically, infetious disease.
The cells, molecules and tissues responsible for immunity consititute 

Immunology: Study of immune respponses -> celluar and molecular event that occur after an organism encouters microbes and other foreign macromolecules

However, even noninfectious foreign substances and products of our own damaged and malignant (tumor) cells can elicit immune responses

A more inclusive definition of the immune response: The reaction to microbes and to molecules that are recognized as foreign or abnormal -> regardless of the physiologic or pathologicconsequence of such a reaction.

Stimulus of Immune Response
- Infection, Injury, Toxins and chemiscal exposure, Stress, Physical stress, Growth and development
  
Defense against infections, tumors
Control of tissue regeneration and scarring
The immune system can injure cells and induce pathologic inflammation
The immune system recognizes and responds to tissue grafts and newly introduced proteins

### Beginning of Immunology
- In 1796, Edward Jenner demonstrated that individuals pre-inoculated with cow pox two months prior are protected from smallpox
- He called this process Vaccination
- It look almost two centuries for smallpox vaccine to become universally available

### Various type of pathogens greatly vary in many ways
- Viruses, Intracellular bacteria, Extracellular bacteria/archeae/protozoa, Fungi, Parasites

Innate Immune System: Neutrophil, Basophil, Eosinophil, Monocyte, Macrophage, Mast Cell, Natural Killer
- Always present in headlty individuals (innate)
- Immediate protection (preventing entry or rapid elimination)
- Sometimes called "non-specific" but "broadly specific" is better description
- Found in neonetal animals, vertebrates and invertebrates
- 

Dendritic cell

Adaptive Immune System: T Lymphocyte, B Lymphocyte (Take time to adap/acquire specificity)
- Adaptive, specific or acquired immunity / Immune system
- requires prolifratioin and adaptation specificity of lymphcytes (Adaptive Immune Cells) before providing a response)
- Adapts spcifically 


Reflection
How individual's immune system recognize, respond to, and eliminate many foreign antigens but usuallly does not attack body's own (self) antigens and tissues

How?
What is the manifestation if one's own immune system react against self antigens?
