All immune cells are originated from bone marrow

Lymph Node, Thymus, 

Innate Immune System: Natural Killer Cell
Adaptive Immune System: T Cell, B Cell

Immunity: protection from disease and, more specifically, infetious disease.

Immunology: Study of immune respponses -> celluar and molecular event that occur after an organism encouters microbes and other foreign macromolecules

However, even noninfectious foreign substances and products of our own damaged and malignant (tumor) cells can elicit immune responses

A more inclusive definition of the immune response: The reaction to microbes and to molecules that are recognized as foreign or abnormal -> regardless of the physiologic or pathologicconsequence of such a reaction.

Stimulus of Immune Response
- Infection, Injury, Toxins and chemiscal exposure, Stress, Physical stress, Growth and development
  
Defense against infections, tumors
Control of tissue regeneration and scarring
The immune system can injure cells and induce pathologic inflammation
The immune system recognizes and responds to tissue grafts and newly introduced proteins
