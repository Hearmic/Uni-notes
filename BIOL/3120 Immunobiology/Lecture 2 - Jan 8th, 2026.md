### Components of the immune system
- Physical constitutive barriers
- Cellular components
- Lymphoid tissues
- Molecular/secreted components

### Physical constitutive barriers
- Mechanical factors/physical barriers intact epithelial surfaces (e.g. Skin, mucosal membranes)
- Chemical Factors (e.g. antimicrobial peptides at eptithelial surfaces)
	- e.g. defensins and the cathelicidins
- Biological factors (e.g. enzymes, low pH)
	- E.g. enzymes: lysozyme in saliva, tears and sweat
