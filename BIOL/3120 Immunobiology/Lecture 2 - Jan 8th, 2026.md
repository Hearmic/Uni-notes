### Components of the immune system
- Physical constitutive barriers
- Cellular components
- Lymphoid tissues
- Molecular/secreted components

### Physical constitutive barriers
- Mechanical factors/physical barriers intact epithelial surfaces (e.g. Skin, mucosal membranes)
- Chemical Factors (e.g. antimicrobial peptides at eptithelial surfaces)
	- e.g. defensins and the cathelicidins
- Biological factors (e.g. enzymes, low pH)
	- E.g. enzymes: lysozyme in saliva, tears and sweat
### Cellular components
- Vary by location, shape, and function
- Most are derived from a single precursor in the bone marrow, called ==**hematopoietic stem cells**==
- Most cells circulate in the blood or the lymph; we call them **==leukocytes==** or white blood cells.
- Others are present in tissue at all times, called **==tissue resident==**
	- Two main groups:
	- ==Myeloid== lineage cells (mostly innate cells, but not all)
	- ==Lymphoid== lineage cells (mostly adaptive cells, but not all)

- Two types are present in bone marrow: ==hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)== and ==mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)==.
- HSC and MSC are multipotent
- HSC -> all blood cells -> some of them further mature into highly specialized cells (e.g. monocyte maturation to osteoclasts)
- MSC differentiate -> connective tissue cells (bone, cartilage, ligament, tendon, stromal fibroblasts, and adipocytes)
#### Cells of the innate immune system

Phagocytes: Nutropills, Monocytes
Innate Immune cells: Nutropills, Monocytes, Macrophages, DCs
Antigen-presenting cells: Macrophage, DCs, B cells

Dendritic Cell
Phagocytes
Neutrophils (Nu)
Basophils
Eosinophils
Mast Cells
Natural Killer Cells (NK)
Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs)


Granulocytes: Neutrophils (Nu), Basophils, Eosinophils)

#### Neutrophils:
- Numerous (An adult human produces more than $1*10^{11}$ per day)
- Circulates in the blood for a few hours or up to 5 days before dying
- After entering tissues, neutrophils function for only 1 to 2 days, and most of them then die
- Granules contain various toxic proteins and enzymes used to destroy the pathogen, taken by phagocytosis
- Extrude granules and nuclear content to immobilize and kill microbes
##### NETs = Neutrophil Extracellular Traps
- Neutrophil dies and extrudes (force out) its DNA
- DNA is very sticky and traps bacteria
- Macrophages clean up the mess

#### Myeloid lineage immune cells
Granulocytes: - Polymorphonuclear granulocytes

Eosinophils & Basophils
- Granules contain various toxic proteins and enzymes that is released when they get activated
- Extracelluar- No phagocytic activity
- Parasitic and allergic responses
- Circulate in the blood
- Basophils express IgE receptors, bind IgE, and can be triggeredby antigen binding to IgE.
- Various membrane receoptors on eosinophils (Fc receopters for IgA and IgG, TLRs, and IL-5 receptors) can activate the cells to release their granule contents
- Basophil numbers are low in tissues -> their importance in host defense and allergic reactions is uncertain.

#### Myeloid lineage immune cells
Mast Cells
- Structurally and functionally similar to basophils but, T
