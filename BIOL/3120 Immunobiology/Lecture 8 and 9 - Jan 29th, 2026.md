### T and B cell development
- Cytotoxic T cells (CTL) are CD8+ T cells that lyse target cells (TC) -> CD8 T cell 
- CD8+ T Cells recognize antigens presented on MHC I molecules

Why is only MHC II protected with invariant chain?
- Only MHC class II uses the invariant chain because class II loads peptides in endosomal/lysosomal compartments, whereas class I loads peptides in the ER
- MHC Class I = constant self-surveillance
- MHC I's job is to show CD8+ T Cells a snapshot of what's being made inside the cell. - Endogenous peptides
- MHC II is for: Exogenous peptides, coordinating immune responses, activating CD4+ helper T cells

### Commitment of common lymphoid progenitors to the B or T cell lineage
- Depends on transcriptional regulators -> Either B/T Cells
- Notch1 and GATA3 commit developing 

### Proliferation
- The massive proliferation occurs after successful rearrangement of one of the two chains of the T or B cell receptor. (pre-antigen receptor - Ig heavy chain gene or the TCR $|beta$ chain gene)
- Signals gener
