### T and B cell development
- Cytotoxic T cells (CTL) are CD8+ T cells that lyse target cells (TC) -> CD8 T cell 
- CD8+ T Cells recognize antigens presented on MHC I molecules

Why is only MHC II protected with invariant chain?
- Only MHC class II uses the invariant chain because class II loads peptides in endosomal/lysosomal compartments, whereas class I loads peptides in the ER
- MHC Class I = constant self-surveillance
- MHC I's job is to show CD8+ T Cells a snapshot of what's being made inside the cell. - Endogenous peptides
- MHC II is for: Exogenous peptides, coordinating immune responses, activating CD4+ helper T cells

### Commitment of common lymphoid progenitors to the B or T cell lineage
- Depends on transcriptional regulators -> Either B/T Cells
- Notch1 and GATA3 commit developing 

### Proliferation
- The massive proliferation occurs after successful rearrangement of one of the two chains of the T or B cell receptor. (pre-antigen receptor - Ig heavy chain gene or the TCR $\beta$ chain gene)
- Signals generated by pre-antigen receptors are responsible for this proliferation of developing lymphocytes
- Earlier proliferation to Pro-(B/T cell receptor) driven by cytokines such as IL-7 secreted by thymic stromal cells
- Amount: 10&7 ti 10^9 different B and T lymphocyte clones
- Each clone produces an antigen receptor with a unique antigen-binding structure.
- Large and diverse lymphocyte repertoires: a fairly small number of genes -> give rise to a vast number of district 

### Receptor rearrangement
- Antigen receptor genes are split into multiple gene segments 
	- Variable
	- Diversity
	- Joining
	- Constant
- A functional exon is created only after somatic recombination

1) Segments of antigen receptor genes randomly recombine
2) Nucleotide sequence variations are introduced at the joints
3) Production of a large number of variable regions of the receptors

Diverse antigen receptors are generated and expressed before encounter with antigens

### Selection / Checkpoints
Expression of the pre-antigen receptor is the first checkpoint during lymphocyte development
- pre-BCRs contain only one of the two polypeptide chains present in a mature receptor. (expressed with surrogate chains)

### B and T Cell development
- In the next step of selection/checkpoint, developing B and T cells express complete antigen receptors, and the cells are selected for survival
- Positive selection: If the formed receptor binds to
	- Survival of potentially useful lymphocytes.
	- T cell receptors recognize self-MHC molecules
	- The co-receptor on a T cell (CD8 or CD4) is matched to the appropriate type of MHC molecules (I or II)

### B-cell negative selection
- Strongly self-reactive immature B cells may be induced to make further Ig gene rearrangements -> avoid self-reactivity (receptor editing)
If editing fails -> called clonal deletion
Some B cells exhaust rearrangement efforts -> signaled to die by apoptosis 
55B/day B cells die in the bone marrow (unsuccessful rearrangement or self-reactive)

### Human Immunoglobin Loci - Germline organization
V regions are not encoded as a complete Ig/TCR domain in a single gene segment
A functional exon is created only after somatic recombination
For this reason, the process "somatic recombination" or ===VDJ=== recombination leads to the gene rearrangement 
-> results new lymphocytes with numerous possible combinations of antigen receptors -> Combinatorial diversity

### TCR gene segments - Gernline organizatin
