Random Sample
1. Every individual/object ahs an equal chance of being sample
2. Sampled individuals are independent

- Ideal procedure for ensuring a sample is random
- Sample of convenience
  
Categorical Variables: Data fall into distinct groups
- Nominal: categories have no inherent order
- Ordinal: categories ordered along a gradient, but without exact values
- Numerical: Data are quantitative and have magnitude
- Discrete: indivisible numerical units
