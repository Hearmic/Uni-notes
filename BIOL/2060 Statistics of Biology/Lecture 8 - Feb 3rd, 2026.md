### The four basic steps of hypothesis testing
- $H_0$ 
	- No difference between a parameter and some other value
	- Any difference due to random sampling
- $H_A$
	- The parameter has any value other or > or < than that stated in $H_0$

### 1. State the hypothesis
### 2. Compute a test statistic
### 3. Determined the P-value
### 4. Draw the appropriate conclusions

e.g., "Handedness" in toads.
- Bisazza et al. 1996: 18 common toads (Bufo bufo) captured and tested: 
- Which limb did they most often use to remove a balloon tied to their head
- 14 out of 18 tended to use right hand more often.
- Is right-handedness predominant

- In this case, the parameter of interest = a proportion, p
- H_0: the proportion of right-handed and left-handed toads is the same
- Alternate hypothesis is two-sided
  
- A test statstic is a number calculated form the data that is used to evaluate the null hypothesis
- H_0 predicts 0.5 (1.8) or 9 out of 18, toads will be right-handed
- Actual number = 14 $\to$ This is the test statisitic to be compared with the prediction of 9
- Even if H_0 is true, we could sample 14 right-handed toads purely by chance,
- How likely would that be?

### Null Distribution
- Distribution of possible outcomes for a test statistic, if the null hypothesis is True
- Most statistical tests require that this distribution is known (or assume it to be known)
- If H_0 is true, then each random pick has a 0.5 chance of picking a right-handed toad
- Can create a null distribution by simulating 18 picks thousands of times, and making a frequency histogram of the results:
