## Review
### Percentiles and quantiles are the smallest values below which a proportion of all the values in a distribution lie
- The Xth percentile of a sample is the value below which X% of the observatios like, whereas the Quantile is the fraction
- Using the nearest-rank 
- Ex) 15th perentile and 0.90 quntile of 12 values, pick the nearest value

### The standard error of an estimate is its standard deviation
- Measures the precision of the estimate
- The standard error of the mean = $\sigma_{\overline{Y}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
