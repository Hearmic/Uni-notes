## Review
### Percentiles and quantiles are the smallest values below which a proportion of all the values in a distribution lie
- The Xth percentile of a sample is the value below which X% of the observatios like, whereas the Quantile is the fraction
- Using the nearest-rank 
- Ex) 15th percentile and 0.90 quantile of 12 values, pick the nearest value

### The standard error of an estimate is its standard deviation
- Measures the precision of the estimate
- The standard error of the mean = $\sigma_{\overline{Y}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

## Chapter 5 - Probability
Definitions: A random trial = a process that has two or more possible outcomes that cannot be rpediccted with certainty 
- rolling a die
- Randomly sampling an individual salmon from a population of salmon to see waht its weight is

Event = an outcome of interest
The probability of an even = the proportion of all random trials in which the outcome is the specified event
- must be between 0 and 1
- Pr[A] = "the probability of event A"

### In a Venn Diagram, the probability of an event is proportional to the area it occupies

### Events are mutually exclusive if they cannot both occur at the same time
- e.g., flipping a coin and getting "heads" vs. flipping a coin and getting "tails"
- Sampling a random animal that has teeth vs sampling a random animal that has feathers
### A probability distribution shows (or lists) the probabilities of all the possible outcomes of a random trial
- Discrete probability distributions: for discrete or categorical variables

### The additional rule is used to calculate the probability that one of two or more mutually exclusive events will occur:
$$Pr[A\ or\ B] = Pr[A] + Pr[B]$$
### The general addition rule is used when two events are not mutually exclusive
$$Pr[A\ or\ B] = Pr[A] + Pr[B] - Pr[A\ and\ B]$$

### Events are <u>independent</u> if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other

### Rule of Multiplication: for independent events A and B
$$Pr[A\ and\ B ] = Pr[A]\Pr[B]$$
