## Dependent Event
- Females can control the sex of their offspring
	- If she fertilizes her eggs with stored sperm -> female
	- If she does not fertilize -> male
- If a female finds a pupa that has not been parasitized already, she fertilizes 95% her eggs
	- 5% sons, 95% daughters
	- A few sons can fertilize all the daughters, many grandchildren, but they may suffer from inbreeding


## Conditional Probability
$$Pr[event\ |\ condition]$$ $$Pr[new\ egg\ is\ male\ |\ host\ previously\ parasitized] = 0.9$$
Pr[A] = sigma()_all values of B Pr[B]Pr[A|B]
