## Dependent Event
- Females can control the sex of their offspring
	- If she fertilizes her eggs with stored sperm -> female
	- If she does not fertilize -> male
- If a female finds a pupa that has not been parasitized already, she fertilizes 95% her eggs
	- 5% sons, 95% daughters
	- A few sons can fertilize all the daughters, many grandchildren, but they may suffer from inbreeding


## Conditional Probability
$$Pr[event\ |\ condition]$$ $$Pr[new\ egg\ is\ male\ |\ host\ previously\ parasitized] = 0.9$$
$$Pr[A] = \sum_{all\ values\ of\ B} Pr[B]Pr[A|B]$$
B = all mutually exclusive values of the conditions

- The general multiplication rule is used to find the probability that two dependent events will both occur
- Pr[A and B] = Pr[A] Pr[B | A] or Pr[B] Pr[A | B]
- For jewel wasp, probability that a host is parasitized and an egg will be male

### Probability Rules
- Addition Rule (events that are mutually exclusive)
- General Addition Rule (events that are mutually not exclusive)
- Rule of Multiplication (for independent events)
- Law of Total Probability (dependent events)

#### Quizes
Twelve six-sided dice are rolled. Assume all of the dice are fair
1) How many threes do you expect, on average, out of these 12 rolls?
   Twice (1 / 6 = 2 / 12)
2) What is the probability of rolling no threes out of 12 rolls?
   p = $(\frac{5}{6})^{12}$
3) On average, what is the sum of the number of spots showing on top of the 12 dice?
   Y = 3.5 3.5 * 12 = 42
4) What is the probability that all the dice show only ones and sixes (in any proportion)?
