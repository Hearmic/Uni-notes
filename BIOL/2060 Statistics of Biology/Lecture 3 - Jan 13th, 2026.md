- The ==arithmetic== mean is the most common way to describe location

### Variance and standard deviation are measures of spread around a mean

- The distance between any observation and the mean = $Y_i-\overline{Y}$
- The sum of squares of deviations form the mean is used in measures of spread
- The variance $s^2$, is the same of squares divided by n-1 (average squared deviation)
- Why n-1?
	- To get an average w e normally devide by n.
	- If we calculate deviations around a mean for 6 values, we can actuallyu only calculate 5 numbers that are free to vary:		
	- Given previous deviations, the last one is no longer "free" to vary; it must be -5 because th elast number.in the dat must be 158 (or the maen would not be 163)
	- The last deviation does not give any useful information about the variance
- Degrees of freedom (df) refers to the number of values in the calculation fo a statistic that are free to vary
	- For the calculation for variance, the degrees of freedom is n-1
	- Computer simulations show th euse of n-1 instead of n gives a more accurate estimate of the tru population variance form a smaple of the population
	- Note as n increases, the use of n-1 instead of n will have less effect on s^2
### Standard deviaton, s, is the √ of the variance
- Cannot be negative
- Has same units as the original variable (variance units are in units^2)
- Has an important connection to the normal frequency distribution
- For a variable with a normal distribution 68% of the values like within 1 standard deviation of the mean
- 95% lie within 2 standard deviation
- 99.7% lie within 3 standard deviation

- If conversion requires multiplying original values by a constant, c
