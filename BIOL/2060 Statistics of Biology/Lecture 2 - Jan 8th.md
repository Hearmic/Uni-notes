### Review

Random Sample
1. Every individual/object ahs an equal chance of being sample
2. Sampled individuals are independent

- Ideal procedure for ensuring a sample is random
- Sample of convenience
  
Categorical Variables: Data fall into distinct groups
- Nominal: categories have no inherent order
- Ordinal: categories ordered along a gradient, but without exact values
- Numerical: Data are quantitative and have magnitude
- Discrete: indivisible numerical units

Biased Sampling: under/overrepresentable (ex: dogs brought to clinics)
A larger sample size is beneficial for achieving high precision of results.

Explanatory (Independent) vs Responsive (Dependent) Variables
Common goal: relate one variable to another
Usually, an explanatory variable (treatment variable in an experiment) affects a response variable.
e.g., radiation dose affects survival probability
Radiation dose = explanatory
Survival = response

In observational studies with no experiment, variables may be assumed (sometimes incorrectly) to be explanatory or response
- e.g., blood pressure (explanatory) affects heart attack rate (response)
There can be more than one explanatory and/or response variable
- e.g., sun exposure and skin pigmentation may affect both skin cancer risk and vitamin D deficiency risk

Observational Study: no experimental manipulation
- Variables are measured and data recorded on already available subjects/units
- Treatments of the explanatory variable "self-assigned."
- Can show association but not cause/effect relationships (often used in "exploratory" research) 

Experiemental Study: individuals are ssigned to treatment groups
- Random assignement ensures that differences between groups are due to the experimental treatment
- Can show cause/effect
- Treatments of the explanatory variable assigned by researchers

Frequency distributions: show the relative or absolute number of times a variable has a given value

- The distribution of a variable in the whole population is its probability distribution
- Almost never known
- Theoretical distributions are used as approximations
- For continuous data: the normal distribution ("bell curve")

If we can approximate the distribution of a variable, we can calculate the odds of measuring a value within a certain range
- Often the basis of statistical hypothesis testing
