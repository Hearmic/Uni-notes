### Review

Random Sample
1. Every individual/object ahs an equal chance of being sample
2. Sampled individuals are independent

- Ideal procedure for ensuring a sample is random
- Sample of convenience
  
Categorical Variables: Data fall into distinct groups
- Nominal: categories have no inherent order
- Ordinal: categories ordered along a gradient, but without exact values
- Numerical: Data are quantitative and have magnitude
- Discrete: indivisible numerical units

Biased Sampling: under/overrepresentable (ex: dogs brought to clinics)
A larger sample size is beneficial for achieving high precision of results.

Explanatory (Independent) vs Responsive (Dependent) Variables
Common goal: relate one variable to another
Usually, an explanatory variable (treatment variable in an experiment) affects a response variable.
e.g., radiation dose affects survival probability
Radiation dose = explanatory
Survival = response

In observational studies with no experiment, variables may be assumed (sometimes incorrectly) to be explanatory or response
- e.g., blood pressure (explanatory) affects heart attack rate (response)
There can be more than one explanatory and/or response variable
- e.g., sun exposure and skin pigmentation may affect both skin cancer risk and vitamin D deficiency risk

Observational Study: no experimental manipulation
- Variables are measured and data recorded on already available subjects/units
- Treatments of the explanatory variable "self-assigned."
- Can show association but not cause/effect relationships (often used in "exploratory" research) 

Experiemental Study: individuals are ssigned to treatment groups
- Random assignement ensures that differences between groups are due to the experimental treatment
- Can show cause/effect
- Treatments of the explanatory variable assigned by researchers

Frequency distributions: show the relative or absolute number of times a variable has a given value

- The distribution of a variable in the whole population is its probability distribution
- Almost never known
- Theoretical distributions are used as approximations
- For continuous data: the normal distribution ("bell curve")

If we can approximate the distribution of a variable, we can calculate the odds of measuring a value within a certain range
- Often the basis of statistical hypothesis testing

Graphing Data
- Use the right type of graph
- Single variable: frequency distribution
	- The number (or proportion/percentage) of occurences of each value in the data
- Showing data for a single variable
- For numerical data: use histogram
- Data values split into "bins" of equal width
- Histograms have properties that describe the shape of a frequency distribution
- (Uniform, Bell-shaped, Asymmetric (with -ve skew, Bimodal (also asymmetric with +ve skew)
	- Symmetry (stymmetric as asymmetric)
	- Skew = One "tail" is longer than the other
		- Towards left = negative skew; towards right = positiev
	- Peak = bin surrounded by lower values
	- Mode = Highest Peak
- Outliers are observations well outside the range of values of other observations
	- Should be removed only if investigation reveals them to be errors

- The number of bins can influence a viewer's interpretation of a histogram
	- Bins too small; too much individual data obscures trends
	- Bins too large; loss of information and a distorted 
	- Sturges' "rule of thumb" (a rough guideline):
		- \#bins = 1 + ln(n) / ln(2), rounded up
		- $k = 1 + log_2(n)$
		- Often more bins are needed than Sturges' predicts
		- Use Judgement
		- Use readable numbers
- Left vs Right Closed Bins
	- Data values split into "bins" of equal width but...
	- What do you do with values that are exactly at bin boundaries?
	- e.g., bins 0-10, 10-20, 20-30...where does a 10 go
	- Left closed (right open)-the left of the interval includes the endpoint: 10-20
	- Left closed bins: \[0-10), \[1-20)
- Single variable: Frequency Distribution
- Categorical variable: Bar graph
  
- Showing an association between two variables: the best graph for showing an association between two variables depends on the types of variables involved
	- 1. Categorical explanatory and categorical response
- Contingency table, Grouped bar graphs, Mosaic Plots (width is proportional to sam)
- Stacked bars are used to display the proportional, or relative, frequency of occurrence
