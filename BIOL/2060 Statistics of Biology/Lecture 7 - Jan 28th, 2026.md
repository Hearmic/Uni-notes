-  General Addition Rule
- Rule of Multiplication (independent)
- General Rule of Multiplication (dependent events both occur)
- Law of total probability

### Bayes' Theorem 
$$PR[A|B] = \frac{Pr[B|A]\ Pr[A]}{Pr[B]}$$
Example: Down syndrome (DS) is a chromosomal condition that occurs in ~1 in 100 pregancies
- A previously common test used to identify down tyndrome in a fetus is called the triple test, which screens for levels of three hormones in maternal blood at around 16w weeks of pregnancy.
- Probability that a fetus with DS will be correctly identified as having DS is 0.60 (sensitivity or true positive)
- Probability of incorrectly identifying a normal fetus as having DS is 0.05 (false positive)
- What is the probability that a fetus identified as having DS actually has DS?

$$\frac{[Pr[+ result\ |\ DS]\ Pr[DS]}{Pr[+ result\ |\ no\ DS]} = \frac{0.60 * 0.001}{0.0}$$
