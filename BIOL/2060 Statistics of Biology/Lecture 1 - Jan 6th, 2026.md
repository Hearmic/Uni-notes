Distinguish between a parameters, a statistic, and an estimate, given examples,  
Identify the population of interest, the samples, and  
  
Geneal Goal of Biology:  
Study the properties of living things  
  
Complications:  
Individual Variability  
  
Solution:  
Statictistics: Enables quantification  
  
How can we study the properties of living things?  
Take a representative sample of individuals:  
Draw inferences about the larger population  
  
A body of methods that helps us make inferences  
Quantifies th uncertainty inherent of thoes  
  
Populations can be described using parameters  
- Averages, Proportions, Correlations: Measures of variation  
- A parameter is the true value (ex: average of a random sample of individuals from the population, to estimate the true average)  
  
Hypothesis testing in staticstics  
- A statistical hypothesis:  
a claim about a parameter  
The average height of men is the same as the average height of women  
  
Testing:  
Use of data, based on samples, to evaluate evidence for or against  
  
Taking samples: a case study  
Whitney & Mehlhaff 1987: looked at “Feline High Rise Syndrome” (FHRS)**
Only cats that 1) had injuries and 2) survived their fall were brought to the veterinary clinic 

A population is all the individuals/objects of interest in a study; a sample is a subset of those individuals

Sampling error is the difference, due to chance, between an estimate and the population parameter being estimated

Sample precision is inversely related to the spread of estimates due to sampling error
- Low spread = high precision
- Large samples have lower sampling error and higher precision than small samples
  
Accuracy of an estimate = tendency of an estimate to be close to the true value of the parameter
- Bias of an estimate = a systematic tendency of an estimate to deviate from the true parameter, due to non-random sampling

Precise: Low variability
Accurate, Imprecise: Reproducibility Error
Inaccurate, precise: Systematic Error

To be random, a sample must meet two criteria:
1. Every individual in the population being sampled must have an equal chance of being sampled
   - Problem: accessibility of individuals may differ due to differences in size, behaviour, location, etc.

2.  Sampled individuals must be independent
    - Sampling on e individual should not affect the likelihood of any other individual being sampled
    - If not the case, "true" sample size maybe 

Ideal procedure for ensuring a sample is random
1. Identify and number of every individual/object in the population of interest
2. Decide on the number of individuals to be sampled (n)
3. Randomly generate n integers between on and the number of individuals in the population
4. Sample those individuals whose numbers match the randomly-generated numbers

- But this procedure is impractical for most biological populations

A very non-ideal approach is the sample of convenience
A collection of individuals that are easility available to the researcher
- Usually biased and/or non-independent
- ex) catch-per-unit-effort data used to estimate Northern cod (and other commercial fish) populations
	- number of fish caught / unit time is used to estimate fish population size and set catch quotas accordingly
	- Problem: boats congregate in areas where fish are abundant; they don't "sample" the fishing grounds at random
	- Catch does not decline with declining population size, as assumed
	- In Newfoundland, this resulted in overly optimistic estimates of stock size

Human studies are often susceptible to volunteer bias
Volunteers may be
- Retired or unemployed
- More health conscious
- Low income
- More ill
Sometimes, random sampling is not possible

Variables are characteristics that differ between some / all members of a populations
- Measured on individuals collected in a sample
- Data (singular datum) are the actual measurements
- Categorical variables: data fall into distinct groups (e.g. alive / dead, Nominal if categories have no inherent order (as above), Ordinal if they can be ordered along a gradient, but without exat values: e.g. clothing sizes from S to CXL
- Numerical variables: quantitiative and have magnitude: Continuous have any real-number value within a certain range; e.g., body weight (in kg)
  Discrete: indivisible units; e.g., number of eggs laid

Nominal, Ordinal, Continuous, or Discrete? (ex: method of pathogen transmission)
Nominal: Categories w/ no inherent order (ex: sex)
Ordinal: Ordered can be ordered without exact values (ex: Education level)
Continuous: any real-number value (ex: territory size in km^2, body temperature)
Discrete: indivisible  (ex: # of leaves on a plant)

Discrete vs Continuous Variables
- Discrete variables, if averaged over a period of time, may become continuous variables
  e.g., number of eggs consumed per day
	- if measured per day: discrete
	- if averaged over a month: continous
- Discrete variables are often treated as continous, especially if values are large
	- e.g., genome size (in base pairs)

1.  Nominal, Ordinal, Continuous, or Discrete?
	 - a) Wingspan: Continuous
	 - b) Eye colour: Nominal
	 - c) Species diversity: Discrete
	 - d) Letter grade: Discrete
2. List three populations (not those already mentioned) 
   ex) 
   Population 1: YorkU students
   Random sample: Students from 5 courses from 5 different faculties selected using a random number generator.
   Biased sample: Varsity basketball team
   variable: Height, Numerical, Continuous
