Distinguish between a parameters, a statistic, and an estimate, given examples,  
Identify the population of interest, the samples, and  
  
Geneal Goal of Biology:  
Study the properties of living things  
  
Complications:  
Individual Variability  
  
Solution:  
Statictistics: Enables quantification  
  
How can we study the properties of living things?  
Take a representative sample of individuals:  
Draw inferences about the larger population  
  
A body of methods that helps us make inferences  
Quantifies th uncertainty inherent of thoes  
  
Populations can be described using parameters  
- Averages, Proportions, Correlations: Measures of variation  
- A parameter is the true value (ex: average of a random sample of individuals from the population, to estimate the true average)  
  
Hypothesis testing in staticstics  
- A statistical hypothesis:  
a claim about a parameter  
The average height of men is the same as the average height of women  
  
Testing:  
Use of data, based on samples, to evaluate evidence for or against  
  
Taking samples: a case study  
Whitney & Mehlhaff 1987: looked at “Feline High Rise Syndrome” (FHRS)**
Only cats that 1) had injuries and 2) survived their fall were brought to the veterinary clinic 

A population is all the individuals/objects of interest in a study; a sample is a subset of those individuals

Sampling error is the difference, due to chance, between an estimate and the population parameter being estimated

Sample precision is inversely related to the spread of estimates due to sampling error
- Low spread = high precision
- Large samples have lower sampling error and higher precision than small samples
  
Accuracy of an estimate = tendency of an estimate to be close to the true value of the parmeter
Bias of an estimate = a systematic tendency of an estimate to deviate from the true
