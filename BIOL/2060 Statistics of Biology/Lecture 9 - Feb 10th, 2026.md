Poisson model


### The Poisson distribution
- Clumped, Random, Dispersed (uniform)
$$Expected\ frequency = \frac{e^{\micro} \micro X}{X!} * n$$
- One degree of freedom is lost for each estimated category
- Need to include the expected frequency of everything equal to 

- Contingency analysis tests for an association between two or more categorical variables


### Relative risk
- the probability of an outcome in a treatment group divided by its probability in a control

### Case control
- A sample of individuals that have a condition of interest is compared with a sample of individuals that don't
-
