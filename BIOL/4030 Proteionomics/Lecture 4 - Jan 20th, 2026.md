This panel illustrates the ways in which the authors tried to validate their work based on experimental data from the field
- the workflow to translate a phosphopeptide observation into a possible set of kinases that phosphorylate it
- The kinase of glycogen phosphorylase is among the top two hits in their method
- the most studied kinase of p53 is among the top two hits
- some substrate peptides have many kinases that can phosphorylated them while others like p53 only have a few.
