- On the kinases sampled, they could be. classified into families each with a families each with a certain sequence preference
- Notably, the consensus sequence not only has positive selection at a given site for an amino acid, but also negative selection. Charged amino acids often serve a negative selection role.

The substrate specificity could be reduced further to three types (0.41% general types)
- 12.40% (1.60% overlapping with the second)
	- N-terminal Arg
	- R-x-x-S/T
	- R-x-S/T
- 20.09% (3.48% overlapping with the third)
	- +1 Pro
	- S/T-P
- 16.92% (4.96% overlapping with first)
	- Acidic
	- [DE]-x-x-S/T
	- [DE]-x-S/T
	- S/T-[DE]-x[DE]

The substrate uncovered for a given kinase helps model it location in the kinase if the structure is not known
