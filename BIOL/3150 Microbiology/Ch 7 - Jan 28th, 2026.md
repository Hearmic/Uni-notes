### Transcription Factor
- Protein that regulate the rate of expression of the gene by binding to DNA.

### The Operon for Negative Control
- A segment of DNA made up of a promoter, an operator, and a cluster of genes
- Operon expression is controlled by the operator
- Negative Control involves the regulation of a repressor protein
- Repression: A process by which the transcription of an enzyme's gene is inhibited when its substrate is in excess
- Induction: Process by which the transcription of an enzyme's gene is activated in response to an excess of its substrate


## Negative Control
### Repression
- Arginine acts as a corepressor that binds to the repressor of the arginine gene, thereby the number of arginine synthesizing enzyme is regulated
### Induction (removing repressor)
- When an excess of lactose is present, it binds to LacI repressor, which is then released from the DNA, thereby activating the synthesis of $\beta$-Galactosidase for lactose breakdown. In that case, lactose acts as an inducer (allolactose)

## Positive Control
### Induction (activator)
- maltose as a Inducer bind to the MalT activator protein, which changes the conformation of the activator and binds to the operon, recruiting RNA polymerase, and transcription proceeds.

## Activator Binding Site and Promoter
- Both might be far apart; in that case, the DNA remodeling protein bend DNA so the activator can interact with the RNA polymerase which bind to promoter sequence.

### Operon: Promoter + Additional sequences + Genes
- Constitutive Control: Genes are continuously expressed under normal cellular conditions
- Negative Control: Regulatory Mechanisms inhibit gene expression
- Positive Control: stimulate gene expression

#### When the genes in an operon are repressed, no product is made from those genes. -> False
- There's always a basal expression to afford rapid environmental change.

## Global Control Systems (Section 7.8)
- Mechanisms that respond to environmental stimuli by regulating the expression of many different genes


| System              | Signal          | Primary activity of regulatory Protein | Number of gnenes regulated |
| ------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Aerobic Respiration | Presence of O_2 | Repressor (ArcA)                       |                            |

### Catabolite Repression
- Mainly involves "cyclic AMP receptor protein" or "Catabolite Activator Protein" (CRP)
- RNA polymerase will only bind to promoter if CRP already bound to a site slightly upstream of the promoter.
- CRP only bind to DNA if cAMP bound to the CRP molecule
- Adenylate cyclitase catalyze conversion of ATP to cAMP, which is inhibited by glucose

### Lac Operon
- High Glucose inhibit ATP $\to$ cAMP
- cAMP bind to CRP protein, which then bind to CRP binding site, 
- Inducer bind to active repressor which then bind to operator and blocks transcription

| Glucose [] | Lactose [] | cAMP [] | Lac |     |
