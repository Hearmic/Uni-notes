### Transformation - Induction of competence by special environmental cues
1. Quorum-sensing mechanism
2. Genotoxic stresses
3. Lack of preferred carbon sources

Lack of preferred carbon sources -> Catabolite repression

1. Transformation involves DNA uptake (by competence specific protiens) and subsequent integration into the recipient cell's genome (by homologous recombination).
2. The proteins required for the transformation processes are all coded for by the genome of a competent recipient cell.
3. Competence can be induced by quorum sensing, DNA damage, or a lack of certain nutrients in the cell.
4. Transformation can result in the acquisition of new genes (e.g., those for antibiotic resistance or pathogenicity).
