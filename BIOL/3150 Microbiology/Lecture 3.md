### Transformation - Induction of competence by special environmental cues
1. Quorum-sensing mechanism
2. Genotoxic stresses
3. Lack of preferred carbon sources

Lack of preferred carbon sources -> Catabolite repression

1. Transformation involves DNA uptake (by competence specific protiens) and subsequent integration into the recipient cell's genome (by homologous recombination).
2. The proteins required for the transformation processes are all coded for by the genome of a competent recipient cell.
3. Competence can be induced by quorum sensing, DNA damage, or a lack of certain nutrients in the cell.
4. Transformation can result in the acquisition of new genes (e.g., those for antibiotic resistance or pathogenicity).

### Transduction
- Virus infection chromosomes disruption
### Generalized transduction: DNA from any prortion of the host genome is packaged inside the virion
- Sometimes host DNA accidentally packaged into phage, forming thransductng particle that is defective and cannot lead to viral lytic infection
- Donor genes cannot replicate
- Recipient infected by transducing particle, homologous recombination 

- Gram-positive (+): phage binds to receptors on the peptidoglycan cell wall.
- Gram-negative (-): Phages bind to receptors on the LPS layer or via the ==Porin== proteins (or both in some cases). 
- Both processes are called Adsorption
- Low efficiency

### Specialized Transduction
![[Pasted image 20260212102534.png]]
- CI protein repressor: prevents lytic genes from being transcribed (promotes lysogeny)
- CRO transcriptional repressor: binds to an operator that represses CL expression (promotes lytic cycle)
- ex) Phage Lambda
- High efficiency (all the phages would have bacterial genes)

### Determining distance between genes (2-factor cross)
- Donor cells (metB+, argH+) -> Grow P1 phage -> Transduce recipient cells (metB-, argH-) -> How can you check for the presence of the functional metB gene?

### Mapping gene order (3-factor cross)
- Donor strain A+, B-, C+
- Recipient strain A-, B+, C-
- Possible transductions 

| Possible transductants | Actual number |
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| Class 1 A+ B- C+       | 100           |
| Class 2 A+ B- C-       | 25            |
| Class 3 A+ B+ C+       | 2             |
| Class 4 A+ B+ C-       | 25            |
Comparing class 2 and 3, can figure out A and B is closer each other than A and C genes
Gene order: A B C or C B A


### Conjugation
![[Pasted image 20260212110220.png]]
When F plasmid is transferred from donor (F+ cell) to recipient (F- cell)
Important proteins in conjugation: TraI, TraN, TraG, OmpA, DNA polymerase

- Hfr Strain Formation
  ![[Pasted image 20260212110841.png]]
- When chromosomal DNA, containing F plasmid, is transferred from donor (Hfr cell) to the recipient (F- cell)
- F plasmid nicked in one strand -> Transfer of F followed by chromosomal DNA -> Synthesis of second strand in recipient
	- Risk: it can be terminated early before passing the entire F plasmid
