### Transformation - Induction of competence by special environmental cues
1. Quorum-sensing mechanism
2. Genotoxic stresses
3. Lack of preferred carbon sources

Lack of preferred carbon sources -> Catabolite repression

1. Transformation involves DNA uptake (by competence specific protiens) and subsequent integration into the recipient cell's genome (by homologous recombination).
2. The proteins required for the transformation processes are all coded for by the genome of a competent recipient cell.
3. Competence can be induced by quorum sensing, DNA damage, or a lack of certain nutrients in the cell.
4. Transformation can result in the acquisition of new genes (e.g., those for antibiotic resistance or pathogenicity).

### Transduction
- Virus infection chromosomes disruption
### Generalized transduction: DNA from any prortion of the host genome is packaged inside the virion
- Sometimes host DNA accidentally packaged into phage, forming thransductng particle that is defective and cannot lead to viral lytic infection
- Donor genes cannot replicate
- Recipient infected by transducing particle, homologous recombination 

- Gram-positive (+): phage binds to receptors on the peptidoglycan cell wall.
- Gram-negative (-): Phages bind to receptors on the LPS layer or via the ==Porin== proteins (or both in some cases). 
- Both processes are called Adsorption

### Specialized Transduction
![[Pasted image 20260212102534.png]]
- CI protein repressor: prevents lytic genes from being transcribed (promotes lysogeny)
- CRO transcriptional repressor: binds to an operator that represses CL expression (promotes lytic cycle)
- ex) Phage Lambda
