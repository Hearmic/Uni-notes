### Gene regulation during $\lambda$ phage infection
- When expressed, the N protein binds to nut sites on the nascent N and cro RNAs
- This allows it to interact with transcribing RNAP molecules (with a complex of other bacterial proteins)
- This causes a conformational change in RNAP that allows it to ignore the terminators found at the end of the N and cro genes.
- Antitermination by N aloows transcription of the delayed early genes
	- N and cro continue to be expressed
- Antitermination

- During the delayed early phase, the CII protein is expressed. It plays a critical role in the decision between lytic and lysogenic phases
- If the host bacteria are growing well (rich nutrient conditions) 
	- The bacteria produce high levels of proteases
	- Because CII is unstable, these proteases easily degrade it.
	- The phage enters the lytic cycle

- Establishing the lysogenic phage: Activation of the $P_{RE}$ promoter CII activates transcription from the $P_{RE}$ promoter (Activation)
- Antisense downregulation:
	- Establishing the lysogenic phage: Downregulation of Cro expression
		- The transcript generated by $P_{RE}$  contains a region that is complementary to the cro mRNA region.
		- By annealing of these two RNAs, translation of the cro ORF is blocked
	- The cl portioin of the transcript remains 
- Feedback Inhibition:
	- Maintaining lysogeny: Feedback inhibition of $\lambda$ repressor expression
		- High levels of $\lambda$ repressor block its own promoter
- Derepression:
	- Excap from lysogeny: Degradation of $\lambda$ repressor
	- DNA damagaing agents (UV light) trigger sefl-cleavage of the $\lambda$ 
- Antitermination
	- At the decision point, if CII is degraded, the lytic cycle proceeds.
		- Key to this is build up of the delayed early gene product Q.
		- Q functions as an antiterminator, that allows for transcr
