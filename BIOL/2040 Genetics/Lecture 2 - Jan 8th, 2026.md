### Chromosome shapes based on the centromere
The order based on similarity in the length of each arm: metacentric $\to$ submetacentric $\to$ acrocentric $\to$ telocentric

**metacentric**: a central centromere with equal-length arms (V-shape)
**Submetacentric**: an off-center centromere, creating unequal but significant arms (J-shape)
**Acrocentric**: a centromere near the end, with a very short p-arm and long q-arm;
**Telocentric** has the centromere at the very end, with only one arm (I-shape)
