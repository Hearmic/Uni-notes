### Human genetic diversity
Measurable locations in the human genome (~2.9 B sites)
Observed variants within 609 individuals from the Americas (~39 M sites, <1%)
Common variants within 609 individuals from the Americas (~10 M sites)

### Learning Outcomes
- Evaluate the societal and ethical impacts of various genetic techniques, studies, and applications
- Evaluate how genes, genetic backgrounds, developmental timing, and environment can interact to produce a phenotype.
- Integrate knowledge of mechanisms by which an organism's genome can be passed to the next generations (and factors, such as linkage, that can impact such outcomes) to solve problems.
- Evaluate how the molecular anatomy of genes and genomes (and mutations therein) can influence inheritance and expression of genes.
