### Quorum sensing
- Biofilm: a microbial community attached to a surface within a matrix of secreted polymers, can form on natural or artificial surfaces

### Why do biofilms form?
- Self-Defense
- Keeps cells in a favorable environment
- Allows cells to live together cooperatively
- Likely a "default" growth mode

### How do biofilms form?
1. Attachment (adhesion of a few motile cells to a suitable solid surface) (Cyclic-di-GMP level increase, they are no longer called plankton, but Sessile)
2. Colonization (intercellular communication, growth, and polysaccharide formation) (matrix formation)
3. Development (more growth and polysaccharides) (water channels (holes), ensure the disposal of waste product from bacterial metabolism)
4. Active Dispersal (triggered by environmental factors such as nutrient availability)
