### Quorum sensing
- Biofilm: a microbial community attached to a surface within a matrix of secreted polymers, can form on natural or artificial surfaces

### Why do biofilms form?
- Self-Defense
- Keeps cells in a favorable environment
- Allows cells to live together cooperatively
- Likely a "default" growth mode

### How do biofilms form?
1. Attachment (adhesion of a few motile cells to a suitable solid surface) (Cyclic-di-GMP level increase, they are no longer called plankton, but Sessile)
2. Colonization (intercellular communication, growth, and polysaccharide formation) (matrix formation)
3. Development (more growth and polysaccharides) (water channels (holes), ensure the disposal of waste product from bacterial metabolism)
4. Active Dispersal (triggered by environmental factors such as nutrient availability)

- Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation under confocal scanning microscope
- Ex) Soap sum in the shower, toothbrush, contact lens cases


### Bacterial Genetics - Horizontal Gene Transfer

### Plasmids are genetic elements that replicate independently of the chromosome.
- Typically circular dsDNA (but linear ones are known)
- Vary from ~1kb to >1000kb

Bacterial DNA: Bacterial Plasmids
- Vertical gene transfer: Transmission of genetic traits from generation to generation (parent to offspring)

Mutation vs Horizontal Gene Transfer
- Mutation: A spontaneous change in the DNA sequence within a gene that may lead to a change in the trait which this gene 

### Three mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer
- Transformation
- Transduction
- Conjugation

### Homologous Recombination
Donor Cell -> Recipient Cell
RecBCD (nicks and unwinds DNA)
DprA

1. Endonuclease nicks DNA
2. Binding of SSD protein -> Recipient DNA
3. Strand invasion
4. Development of cross-strand exchange
5. Resolution of each site (RuvA, RuvB, and RuvC) -> Patches, Splices (heteroduplex)

- Effect of homologus Recombination on Genotype
	- To generate new genotypes, the homologous sequences must be related but distinct.
	- In bacteria, genetic recombination occurs after fragments are transferred by transformation, transduction, or sometimes conjugation
	- To detect exchange of DNA, recombinant cells must be phenotypically different from both parents

### Transformation
- Unlike the other two mechanisms, genetic information is passed through the extracellular environment
- DNA Uptake: Requires expression of competence-specific proteins in the recipient cell wall (e.g., Com and Pil proteins)

### Competence: a physiological state enabling a bacterium to bind and take up exogenous DNA.
