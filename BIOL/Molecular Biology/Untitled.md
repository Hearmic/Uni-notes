flagellar response to a chemoattractant vs chemorepellent

### Quorum sensing
- Biofilm: a microbial community attached to a surface within a matrix of secreted polymers, can form on natural or artificial surfaces

### Why do biofilms form?
- Self-Defense
- Keeps cells in a favorable environment
- Allows cells to live together cooperatively
- Likely a "default" growth mode

### How do biofilms form?
- Attachment (adhesion of a few motile cells to a suitable solid surface)
- Colonization (intercellular communication, growth, and polysaccharide formation)
- Development (more growth and polysaccharides)
- Active Dispersal (triggered by environmental factors such as nutrient availability)
