Phytoremediation

Morphological species
Pylogenetical species
### Plant speciation arises through:
==Allopatry==: Physical isolation of species - as in Platanus orientalis and Platanus occidentalis
==Symptry==: Where there's no physical isolation, but polyploidy - either autopolyploidy or allopolyploidy

==Autopolyploidy==: when there are multiple copies of chromosomes, happens within an individual when cytokinesis does not follow meiosis, or gametes fuse
==Allopolyploidy==: When two different species cross, producing an interspecific hybrid (mostly sterile)
- But sometimes, the allopolyploid goes through autopolyploidy and a new spp. is formed
