Allopatry
Symptry

Autopolyploidy: when there are multiple copies of chromosomes, happens within an individual when cytokinesis doesn not follow meiosis, or gametes fuse
Allopolyploidy: When two differnet species cross producing an interspecific hybrid (mostly sterile)
- But sometimes, the allopolyploid goes through autopolyploidy and a new spp.
