### Gene Flow: Movement of alleles from one population to another
- Continual gene flow between populations results in the population becoming more genetically similar -> reduced genetic differences between populations
- Gene flow is random with respect to fitness
- can bring in alleles that have relative low fitness in new environment
- Donor population: Could decrease genetic variation
- Recipient population: Could increase genetic variation

### Genetic Drift
- Allele frequency fluctuation
- Not related to fitness (no net effect)
	- 1. Population bottleneck: sudden reduction in population size, e.g., caused by disease outbreaks and natural catastrophes
	- 2. Founder effect: a small group of individuals establishes a new population in a new area, i.e. dispersal

### Gene flow can restore genetic variation in a population that has experienced drift
