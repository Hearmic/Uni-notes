### Gene Flow: Movement of alleles from one population to another
- Continual gene flow between populations results in the population becoming more genetically similar -> reduced genetic differences between populations
- Gene flow is random with respect to fitness
- can bring in alleles that have relative low fitness in new environment

### Genetic Drift
- Allele frequency fluctuation
- Not related to fitness (no net effect)
