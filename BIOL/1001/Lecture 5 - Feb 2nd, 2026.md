## Type of Natural Selection
### 1.  Directional Selection
   Change the average value of traits
   Genetic variation $\to$ reduced
### 2. Stabilizing Selection
   No Change the average value of traits
   Genetic variation $\to$ reduced
### 3. Diversifying (Disruptive) Selection
   Genetic variation $\to$ maintained
### 4. Balancing selection
   Genetic variation $\to$ maintained
1. Fitness varies in time & space
2. Heterozygote advantage
   ex) Sickle Cell Allele (heterozygotes do not suffer from both anemia and Malaria)
3. Frequency-dependent selection (negative frequent dependent selection: rare phenotype is beneficial for survival)

### 1. Adaptation aren't universally good
- An adaptation increases the fitness of an individual in a particular environment
