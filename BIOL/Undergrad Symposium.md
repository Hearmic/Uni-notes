Can the small molecule ATP link energy failure to brain disease?

H = Panx1 channels act as an ATP "gate" at synapses and couple neuronal energy state to circuit communication
- Gene-edited zebrafish (causlity)
- Moleculear/celluar (synapse + stres pathways)

The action of MPTP is selective

Comparing the differntial gene expression in untreated and MPTP-treated WT and KO larvase.

Transcriptomics, RNAseq & Bioinformatics (Bioconductor, R)
Result: Revealed how metabolic stress and Panx1 losses reprogram the entire 

### Two methods of 
==Cannabinoids== are specialized metabolites produced by Cannabis
Specialized metabolites defend against harmful organisms
Produced in glandular trichomes
Diverse

THC, CBD

Understanding the regulation of cannabinoid production in vivo is a challenge
Current methods require interdisciplinary expertise, or use tissues lacking trichomes

Can we develop high-throughput methods to transiently express genes Cannabis tissues
