Can the small molecule ATP link energy failure to brain disease?

H = Panx1 channels act as an ATP "gate" at synapses and couple neuronal energy state to circuit communication
- Gene-edited zebrafish (causlity)
- Moleculear/celluar (synapse + stres pathways)

The action of MPTP is selective

Comparing the differntial gene expression in untreated and MPTP-treated WT and KO larvase.
