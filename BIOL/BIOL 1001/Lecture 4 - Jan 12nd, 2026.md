### Evolution by Natural Selection
Observation: Characteristics of a population change over time. (pattern)
Proposed explanation: Individuals with certain heritable traits produce more offspring than those without those traits. (Mechanism)
Predictions: 1) All species are related by descent from a common ancestor; 2) All species come from (descend) from other pre-existing species

Evolution is not "scientifically controversial"
Evolution is observable & testable

Hypothesis must:
- Clearly establish mutually exclusive alternative explanations for a phenomenon, i.e. only one scenario can hold true
- Generate testable predictions
- Needs to be able to testable empirically

Example: A Plant grows faster in higher $CO_2$ concentration, but has a limit
-> Need an explanation why that limit exists

The Alternative Hypothesis must be tested independently
- Observation: John isn't home
- Hypothesis 1: because he is in a glocery store
- Hypothesis 2: because he is a secret superhero

Currently, there are no alternative scientific hypotheses/theories for the diversity of life
Remember: within the scientific community, evolution is not controversial
- Intelligent Design (ID) has been proposed as a "scientific alternative" explanation

### What is intelligent design
- Intelligent Design suggests that the universe and diversity of life is too complex to have evolved (via natural processes) and thus require a celestial intervention (i.e., intelligent designer)
- i.e., each and every organism was put on Earth in the exact form we see it in today.
