### Evolution by Natural Selection
Observation: Characteristics of a population change over time. (pattern)
Proposed explanation: Individuals with certain heritable traits produce more offspring than those without those traits. (Mechanism)
Predictions: 1) All species are related by descent from a common ancestor; 2) All species come from (descend) from other pre-existing species

Evolution is not "scientifically controversial"
Evolution is observable & testable

Hypothesis must:
- Clearly establish mutually exclusive alternative explanations for a phenomenon, i.e. only one scenario can hold true
- Generate testable predictions
- Needs to be able to testable empirically
