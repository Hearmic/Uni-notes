### Nature of Sciecne
- What is science
- Scientific Method
- Hypothesis vs Theory
- Hypothesis vs Prediction

### What is Science
"The important thing in science is not to obtain new facts, but to discover new ways of thinking about them."
- Physicist William Lawrence Bragg

### How to study Biology
- Descriptive - observe/describe patterns
- Functional - understand dynamic relationships, mechanisms, etc.
	- Proximate explanations - how
- Evolutionary - understand historic reasons for adaptations, related to fitness
	- Ultimate explanations - why
All three are necessary for 'good' biological understand

ex) Human infants cry
Proximate explanation: cold, hungry, physical separation from caregiver, etc.
Ultimate explanation: it elicits care and defense from mothers and other caregivers.

Scientific Method
1. Make observations (objectively)
2. From a hypothesis attempt to find an explanatiion
3. Make a prediction, attempt to answer the question
4. Verification
	1. Design and perform an experiment
	   Observational, manipulative, or modeling
	2. Analyze results
	3. Draw conclusions
	   Results agree or disagree with the prediction
	4. Write reports

Hypothesis
- Based on a set of observations
- Test hypothesis - make a prediction
- Must be able to test empirically
- Data are more reliable than anecdotes
- All ideas (about the natural world) are open to scrutiny; we modify ideas as new evidence appears > thus science is self-correcting
- Science is a way of looking at the world that involves critical thinking
  
Anecdotal Evidence - (of an account) not necessarily true or reliable, because based on personal accounts rather than facts or research.

Correlation Analysis
a statistical method used to measure the strength of the linear relationship between two variables and compute their association
- Correlation does not necessarily mean causation

Hypothesis 
- Proposed explanation
- Leads to testable prediction

Theory
- Evidence-based overarching explanations for genea
