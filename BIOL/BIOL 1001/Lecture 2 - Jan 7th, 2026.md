### What is Science
"The important thing in science is not to obtain new facts, but to discover new ways of thinking about them."
- Physicist William Lawrence Bragg

### How to study Biology
- Descriptive - observe/describe patterns
- Functional - understand dynamic relationships, mechanisms, etc.
	- Proximate explanations - how
- Evolutionary - understand historic reasons for adaptations, related to fitness
	- Ultimate explanations - why
All three are necessary for 'good' biological understand

ex) Human infants cry
Proximate explanation: cold, hungry, physical separation from caregiver, etc.
Ultimate explanation: it elicits care and defense from mothers and other caregivers.
