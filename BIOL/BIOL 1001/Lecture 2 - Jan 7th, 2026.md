### What is Science
"The important thing in science is not to obtain new facts, but to discover new ways of thinking about them."
- Physicist William Lawrence Bragg

### How to study Biology
- Descriptive - observe/describe patterns
- Functional - understand dynamic relationships, mechanisms, etc.
	- Proximate explanations - how
- Evolutionary - understand historic reasons for adaptations, related to fitness
	- Ultimate explanations - why
All three are necessary for 'good' biological understand

ex) Human infants cry
Proximate explanation: cold, hungry, physical separation from caregiver, etc.
Ultimate explanation: it elicits care and defense from mothers and other caregivers.

Scientific Method
1. Make observations (objectively)
2. From a hypothesis attempt to find an explanatiion
3. Make a prediction, attempt to answer the question
4. Verification
	1. Design and perform an experiment
	   Observational, manipulative, or modeling
	2. Analyze results
	3. Draw conclusions
	   Results agree or disagree with the prediction
	4. Write reports
