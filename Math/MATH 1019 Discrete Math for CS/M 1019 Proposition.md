A logical proposition is a declarative sentence or statement that is unequivocally either true or false, but not both. It serves as the fundamental element in [propositional logic](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=83105bac496dfc01&cs=1&sxsrf=AE3TifMztcz3NUuy03IMfj2DJ_HLlEh0lQ%3A1757606704358&q=propositional+logic&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwid2-uZi9GPAxXArokEHcE0MbQQxccNegQIBBAB&mstk=AUtExfC-l8R5qiUuS9nDlOyDT3uv7FTHkAi4dXVS4ISAhpAnPotU--EOaFez1DLCV6Wf9iQaJf6jR_DznDA3cn8EYMLTXJRVgYLddCsoYfG3dGW8Zb0FY8VQA49osY5Pnqmb2t6K-weccsRkp76-rwUgirBJ93oH4yRud05bISeGNAfCxksYnxVY1msi1uw27HMslZelHxsk72ey2b-vDCjx27voWgBkazQVjjfE3LJMTeFcwOONPr8NhKGRmRMTTbW8f1fmtXUO3bDBmWhXfdHABPIb&csui=3) 

The value of a proposition can be described as True (T or 1) or False (F or 0).
Propositions that cannot be expressed in terms of simpler propositions are called atomic propositions.

Combinations of propositions with [[M 1019 Terms|logical operators]] are called [[M 1019 Compound propositions|compound propositions]]

A statement containing variables that becomes a proposition (either true or false) when the variables are substituted with specific values is called a [[M 1019 Predicate| predicate]]
### Example: 

All the following declarative sentences are propositions.
1. Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States of America.
2. Toronto is the capital of Canada.
3. 1 + 1 = 2.
4. 2 + 2 = 3.
Propositions 1 and 3 are True, whereas 2 and 4 are False.

### Counter example:

Consider the following sentences.
1. What time is it?
2. Read this carefully.
3. x + 1 = 2.
4. x + y = z.
Sentences 1 and 2 are not propositions because they are not declarative sentences. Sentences 3 and 4 are not propositions because they are neither true nor false. Note that each of sentences 3 and 4 can be turned into a proposition if we assign values to the variable
