Logical disjunction is a logical connective represented by "$\vee$" or "or"), which forms a compound statement that is true if at least one of its constituent statements (disjuncts) is true.
### Example:

- "or"

"It is sunny or it is warm."  is true if it is sunny, if it is warm, or if it is both sunny and warm. It is only false if it is neither sunny nor warm. 

### Truth table:

Let p and q be propositions.

| p   | q   | (p $\vee$ q) |
| --- | --- | ------------ |
| T   | T   | T            |
| T   | F   | T            |
| F   | T   | T            |
| F   | F   | F            |
