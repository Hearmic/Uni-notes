Predicates are statements involving variables like: "x>3", "x = y+3", "x=y+z".

To verify that a predicate is always true is generally difficult; this is why [[M 1019 Quantifiers|quantifiers]] are used to express the extent to which a predicate is True over a range of elements.
### Example:
If P(x) denotes "x>3", then:
- P(4) is True 
- P(3) is False
