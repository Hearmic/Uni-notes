### Definition:
A recurrence relation for the sequence {$a_n$} is an equation that expresses $a_n$ in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence, namely, $a_0, a_1,…, a_n−1,$ for all integers $n$ with $n ≥ n_0$, where $n_0$ is a nonnegative integer.

A sequence is called a solution of a recurrence relation if its terms satisfy the recurrence relation.
