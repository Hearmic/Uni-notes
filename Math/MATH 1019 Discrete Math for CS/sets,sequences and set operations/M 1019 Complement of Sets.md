The definition of the complement of A depends on a particular universal set U. 
This definition makes sense for any superset U of A. If we want to identify the universal set U, we would write “the complement of A with respect to the set U.” An element belongs to A if and only if x ∉ A. This tells us that A = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}.
