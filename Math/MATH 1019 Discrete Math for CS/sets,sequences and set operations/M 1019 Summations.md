$a_m, a_m+1,…, a_n$ from the sequence {$a_n$}. We use the notation $Σ^{n}_{j=m}a_j$
(read as the sum from $j = m$ to $j = n of a_j$) to represent $a_m+ a_m+1+⋯+ a_n.$

Here, the variable $j$ is called the index of summation, and the choice of the letter $j$ as the variable is arbitrary; that is, we could have used any other letter, such as $i$ or $k$

| $Σ^{n}_{k=0}ar^k (r ≠ 0)$          | $\frac{ar^{n+1}-a}{r-1} r\neq1$ |
| $Σ^n_{k=1}k$                       | $\frac{n(n+1)}2$                |
| $Σ^n_{k=1}k^2$                     | $\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}6$      |
| $Σ^n_{k=1}k^3$                     | $\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}4$            |
| $Σ^{\infty}_{k=1}x^k \|x\|<1$      | $\frac{1}{1-x}$                 |
| $Σ^{\infty}_{k=1}kx^{k-1} \|x\|<1$ | $\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$             |
