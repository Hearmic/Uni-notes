Sequences are ordered lists of elements, used in discrete mathematics in many ways
A sequence is a discrete structure used to represent an ordered list. For example, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 isa sequence with five terms and 1, 3, 9, 27, 81,…, $n^3$, … is an infinite sequence.

### Definition
A sequence is a [[ M 1019 Functions|function]] from a [[M 1019 Subsets|subset]] of the set of integers (usually either the set {0, 1, 2,…}
or the set {1, 2, 3,…}) to a set S. We use the notation $a_n$ to denote the image of the integer $n$.
We call $a_n$ a term of the sequence

### Example:
Consider the sequence {$a_n$}, where $a_n = \frac{1}n.$
The list of the terms of this sequence, beginning with a1, namely,
$a1, a2, a3, a4,…,$
starts with 
$1, \frac{1}2, \frac{1}3, \frac{1}4, ...$
