 The universal quantifier (∀, for all) and the existential quantifier (∃, there exists). When nested, the order of the quantifiers significantly changes the meaning of the statement. For example, ∀x∃yP(x) (for all x, there exists y such that P(x) is True) is not the same as ∃y∀x (there exists y for all x such that P(x) is True)
