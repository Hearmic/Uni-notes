Rules of inference are logical principles that allow us to **derive valid conclusions** from given premises. They form the foundation for [[M1019 Proofs|proofs]]. In a **proof**, every **premise** or **previously derived statement** is assumed true within the scope of the argument
### 1. Rules of Inference for Propositional Logic

These rules work with **propositional statements** — ones that are **either true or false** — using connectives such as ¬ (not), ∧ (and), ∨ (or), → (implies), and ↔ (if and only if).

 $\therefore$ <- Therefore (it can be subbstitutedwith "$\implies$")

### 2. Rules of Inference for Predicate Logic (Quantifiers)

When statements contain **quantifiers** (∀ “for all”, ∃ “there exists”), propositional rules extend with additional rules that allow reasoning about **elements in a domain**.


| Rule name                | Form(formula) | Example |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------- |
| Universal Instantation   |               |         |
| Universal generalization |               |         |
|                          |               |         |
