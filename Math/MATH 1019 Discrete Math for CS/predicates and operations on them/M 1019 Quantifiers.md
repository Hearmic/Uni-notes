Quantifiers express the extent to which a predicate is True over a range of elements.

There are two types of quantifiers in discrete math:
- [[M 1019 Universal quantifier|Universal quantifiers]]
- [[M 1019 Exestential quantifier|Existential Quantifiers]]

In discrete math, any two [[M 1019 Nested Quantifiers|quantifiers can be nested]], as long as one is within the scope of the other. 

Quantifiers play a key role in [[M1019 Rules of inference|rules of inference]], which allow us to reason logically about quantified statements.
