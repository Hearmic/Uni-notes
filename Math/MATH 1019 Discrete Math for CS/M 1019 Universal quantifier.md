A universal quantifier (symbol: âˆ€) asserts that a predicate is true for **all** elements in a given domain. It is used to express statements like "for every x," "for all x," or "for any x". For example, the statement "for all real numbers $x$, $x^2 \ge x$" uses a universal quantifier to claim the property is true for every value in the domain of real numbers. It is denoted as $\forall x P(x)$ where $P(x)$  is  $x^2 \ge 0$.
