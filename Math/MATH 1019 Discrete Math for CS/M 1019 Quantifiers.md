Quantifiers express the extent to which a predicate is True over a range of elements.

There are two types of quantifiers in discrete math:
- [[M 1019 Universal quantifier|Universal quantifiers]]
- [[M 1019 Exestential quantifiers|Existential Quantifiers]]

In discrete math, any two [[M 1019 Nested Quantifiers|quantifiers can be nested]], as long as one is within the scope of the other. The most common types are the universal quantifier (∀, for all) and the existential quantifier (∃, there exists). When nested, the order of the quantifiers significantly changes the meaning of the statement. For example, ∀x∃yP(x) (for all x, there exists y such that P(x) is True) is not the same as ∃y∀x (there exists y for all x such that P(x) is True)
