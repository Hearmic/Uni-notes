1. If all elements of $A$ are also elements of $B$ or $\forall x(x\in A \implies x\in B)$, we call $A$ a [[M 1019 Subsets|subset]] of $B$ 
   ($A \subseteq B$)
2. If, instead, we want to express that $B$ is a [[M 1019 Supersets|superset]] of $A$, we use the equivalent notation 
   $B \supseteq A$. ($A \subseteq B$ and $B \supseteq A$ are equivalent statements.)
3. Given a set $S$, the [[M 1019 Power sets|power set]] of $S$ is the set of all subsets of the set $S$. The power set of $S$ is denoted by $P(S)$.
4. The [[M 1019 Cartesian products|Cartesian product]] of A and B, denoted by $A\times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b), where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. Hence,$A \times B$ = {$(a, b) ∣ a \in A \wedge b \in B$}.
5. Given a predicate $P$ and a domain $D$, we define the truth set of $P$ to be the set of elements $x$ in $D$ for which $P(x)$ is true. The [[ M 1019 Truth sets|truth set]] of $P(x)$ is denoted by {$x \in D ∣ P(x)$}.
