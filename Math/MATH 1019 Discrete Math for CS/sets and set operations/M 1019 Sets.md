A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is said to contain its elements. We write a ∈ A to denote that a is an element of the set A.
The notation a ∉ A denotes that a is not an element of the set A.

Sets can be represented graphically using Venn diagrams

In Venn diagrams the universal set U, which contains all the objects under consideration, is represented by a rectangle. (Note that the universal set varies depending on which objects are of interest.) Inside this rectangle, circles or other geometrical figures are used to represent sets. Sometimes points are used to represent the particular elements of the set. Venn diagrams are often used to indicate the [[M 1019 Relationship between sets|relationships between sets]].

Two or more sets can be combined in many different ways; those ways are called [[M 1019 Set operations|set operations]].
