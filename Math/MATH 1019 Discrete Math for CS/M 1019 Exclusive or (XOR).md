Logical XOR, or Exclusive OR, is a logical operation denoted by " $\oplus$ " that outputs True if and only if its inputs differ, meaning one input is True and the other is False; if both inputs are the same (both True or both False), the output is False.

### Example:

- "or, but not both"

"You can have either coffee or tea, but not both," is true only if you will have coffee or will have tea, but you can't have both.

### Truth table:

Let p and q be propositions.

| p   | q   | (p $\oplus$ q) |
| --- | --- | -------------- |
| T   | T   | F              |
| T   | F   | T              |
| F   | T   | T              |
| F   | F   | F              |
