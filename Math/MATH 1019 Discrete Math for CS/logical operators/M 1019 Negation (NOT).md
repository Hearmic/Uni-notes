Negation logic is a fundamental logical operation that takes a proposition and produces a new proposition whose truth value is the opposite of the original. Symbolized by symbols like ' $\neg$ ' (not), or a bar over the proposition ($\overline{p}$), negation flips a True statement into a False one and a false statement into a true one. 

### Example:

- "It is not the case that"

If the proposition "It is raining" is True, its negation "It is not the case that it is raining" or "it is not raining" is false, and vice versa.

### Truth table: 

| p   | $\neg$ p |
| --- | -------- |
| T   | F        |
| F   | T        |
