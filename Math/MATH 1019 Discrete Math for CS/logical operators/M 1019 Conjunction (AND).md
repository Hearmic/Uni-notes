A logical conjunction is a logical operation on two propositions that is true if and only if both propositions are true. It is often called "and" and is symbolized by $\wedge$. 
### Example:

- "and"

"It is sunny and I am going to the park" is true only when the statements "It is sunny" and "I am going to the park" are both true.

### Truth table:

Let p and q be propositions

| p   | q   | (p $\wedge$ q) |
| --- | --- | -------------- |
| T   | T   | T              |
| T   | F   | F              |
| F   | T   | F              |
| F   | F   | F              |
