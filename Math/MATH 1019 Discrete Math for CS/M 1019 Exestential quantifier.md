A universal quantifier (symbol: $\exists$) asserts that a predicate is true for **at least one** element in a given domain. It is used to express statements like "there exists x", "for some x", or "there is at least one x". 

### Example 
For example, the statement "there exists a real number $x$, such that $x^2 > x$" uses an existential quantifier to claim the property is true for some value in the domain of real numbers. It is denoted as $\exists x P(x)$ where $P(x)$  is  $x^2 \ge x$.
