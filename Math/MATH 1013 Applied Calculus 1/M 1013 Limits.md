Limits allow us to find out the value of a function as it approaches a certain value but never gets equal to it. The limit is denoted as $lim_{x \to a} = b$ 

Limit exists if and only if the left-hand ($lim_{x \to a^-}$) and right-hand limit ($lim_{x\to a^+}$) are equal to each other.

For $lim_{x \to 0} \frac1 x$ we say $lim_{x \to 0} \frac1 x = \infty$ , this does not mean that the limit exists and is equal infinity this means that as x approaches a certain value (0 in our case) value of a function grows bigger and bigger. 

Using this formula:
$lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+a)-f(x)}h$ 
limits allow to compute a slope of a tangent line to a function ([[M 1013 Derivatives|a derivative of a function]]) at the point $x$
