Inverse functions are denoted by  $y=f^{-1}(x)$. The domain of an inverse function is the same as the range of the original function: $D_{f^{-1}} = R_f$ , and the range of an inverse function is the same as the domain of the original function: $R_{f^{-1}} = D_f$. Only [[M1013 One-to-one function|one to one function]] can be inversed. 
#### Example
Graphs of $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ are symetric about the line $y=x$:
f(x) = 2x + 3 and its inverse f⁻¹(x) = $\frac{(x - 3)}2$ (purple)
y=x (blue)
