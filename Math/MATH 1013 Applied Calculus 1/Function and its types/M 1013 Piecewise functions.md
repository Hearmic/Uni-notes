A piecewise function is a function that is defined by different formulas or "Pieces" over different intervals of its domain. To graph a piecewise function, you graph each piece on its specified interval. 

### Example:

$$
y=|x| \implies
\left\{
	\begin{array}{ll} 
		y=x & x>0 \\
		y=-x & x<0 \\
	\end{array}
\right. 
$$
