_Functions arise whenever one quantity depends on another. Consider the following four_
_situations._

1. The area A of a circle depends on the radius r of the circle.
2. The human population of the world, P(t), depends on the time t. For each value of t, there is a corresponding value of P.
3. The cost C of mailing an envelope depends on its weight w and distance traveled d.
4. The vertical acceleration a of the ground as measured by a seismograph during an earthquake is a function of the elapsed time t. 

The functions have at most one output for each input. It is useful to think of a f

A function f is a rule that assigns to each element x in a set $D_x$ ([[M 1013 Domain of a function|domain]]) Exactly one element, called $f(x)$ (**value of f at x** or **f of x**), in a set $E_x$ ([[M 1013 Range of a function|range]]).

A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the [[M 1013 Domain of a function|domain]] of a function f is called an independent variable. A symbol that represents a number in the [[M 1013 Range of a function|range]] of f is called a dependent variable. For example, in the function $y = x + 1$, $x$ is an arbitrary number, and $y$ is a dependent variable. 

It’s helpful to think of a function as a machine. If $x$ is in the domain of the function $f$, then when *$x$ is entered into the machine, it’s accepted as an input, and the machine produces an output $f(x)$ according to the rule of the function.
