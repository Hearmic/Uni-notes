### 1. Things that work for other students may not suit you, causing you to waste your time.

- Learning strategies are not universally effective. For example, some students benefit from visual aids (like diagrams), while others retain more through active discussion or practice. If you copy someone else’s strategy without considering your own learning style and cognitive strengths, you may put in effort but get little result. This is why self-awareness in learning is crucial.

### 2. Many successful students employ techniques that suit them; as a result, these techniques become less universal and may become harder.

- Successful students often tailor their study methods to their individual needs. These techniques might look unusual or inefficient to others, but they are effective for those students because they match their personal way of processing information. However, when others try to adopt them, the techniques may not work as well, and in fact may even seem more difficult, because they are not aligned with their own cognitive or motivational patterns.

### 3. A lot of successful students use mediocre or bad techniques because they have a better [[L 1 Deep processing ability|deep processing ability]].

-  Sometimes, students succeed not because their study methods are great, but because they naturally have a stronger [[L 1 Deep processing ability|deep processing ability]] — the skill of analyzing, connecting, and making meaning out of information. For them, even surface-level techniques like simple rereading or highlighting may “work,” because their brain is automatically transforming those activities into meaningful learning. For others without the same deep processing strength, those techniques remain shallow and ineffective.
