- Intermediates cannot appear in the rate law

### Catalyst
- Needed at the start of the reaction, but is regenerated at the end
- Where do the chlorine atoms come from?
	- Photo dissociation of chlorofluorocarbon
- 

### Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous Catalyst
- ex) Heterogeneous catalyst: olefin
## Enzymes: Biological Catalysts
- The majority of the tens of thousands of chemical reactions that occur in living cells are too slow at normal temperatures
- Enzymes are large molecules (proteins or RNA) that act as homogeneous catalysts
- Enzymes have complex three-dimensional structures optimized for a particular reaction
- Enzymes provide an alternative mechanism for the biological reaction that is rate-enhanced
- Some enzymes can speed up the reactions by a factor of 10^9
