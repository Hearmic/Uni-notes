Chemical Kinetics: Study of chemical change in time

- How to calculate the concentration of reactants and products at different times during a reaction
- How to use the information on reaction kinetics to understand the molecular steps involved in a reaction (reaction mechanism)
- How temperature affects the rate of chemical reaction
- How chemical reactions can be accelerated by special substances called catalysts
### The Rate of a Chemical Reaction
The rate of change of reactants is negative, as their concentration is decreasing
Unit: mol/L*s = M/s

Why is there a "1/2" in front of the second quotient?
Stoichiometry form 2 moles HI -> 1/2 in rate

$$
aA + bB \to cC + dD
$$

$$
\textit{rate} = - \frac{1}{a}\frac{\Delta[A]}{\Delta t} = - \frac{1}{b}\frac{\Delta[B]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{c}\frac{\Delta[C]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{d}\frac{\Delta[D]}{\Delta t}
$$
- Reaction rate can be expressed using any reactant or product
- Reaction rate is always positive
- The value of reaction rate is independent of which reactant or product was used in the calculation
- Rate of consumption or formation of individual components can be easily calculated from the reaction rate value


Average rate of reaction in 10 seconds
$$
rate = -\frac{1}{3}\frac{0.868 M - 1 M}{10sec} = 4.40*10^{-3} M/s
$$

The rate of change in the concentration of $H^+$

$$
rate = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\Delta [H^+]}{\Delta t} \to -2* rate = \frac{\Delta [H^+]}{\Delta t} = -2 * 4.40*10^{-3} M/s = 8.80*10^{-3}M/s
$$
The average rate of a reaction depends on the width of the chosen time interval ($\Delta$t) - Problematic
Solution: calculate the slope of the tangent to the concentration curve at a given time point. This slope gives the instantaneous reaction rate.

Rate Law: The effect of Concentration on Reaction Rate
The mathmatical relationship between the rate of reaction and the concentrations of reactant is called the rate raw.
$$
Rate = k[A]^n
$$
k is rate constant, n is reaction order with respect to A

- n can only be determined by conducting an experiment
- Typically, n is a small integer, but can be fractional or negative

Zero-Order Reaction:
- If a reaction is zero order, the rate of the reaction is always the same. Doubling \[A\]  will have no effect on the reaction rate 
First-Order Reaction:
- If a reaction is first order, the rate is directly proportional to the reactant concentration. Doubling \[A] will double the rate of the reaction
Second-Order Reaction:
- If a reaction is second order, rate is directly proportional to the square of the reactant concentration. Doubling \[A] will quadruple the rate of the reaction.

Average rate of change vs Instantaneous rate of change
$$
\frac{Rate2}{Rate3} = \frac{k[A]_2^n}{k[B]_2^n} = (\frac{k[A]_2}{k[B]_2})^n = (\frac{0.15 M}{0.40 M})^n = \frac{0.034}{0.240}
$$
$$
0.375^n = 0.142
$$
$$
n*log(0.375) = log(0.142)
$$
$$
n = \frac{log(0.142)}{log(0.375)}
$$

Rate Law for Reactions with Multiple Reactants
$$
aA + bB \to cC + dD
$$
$$
rate = k[A]^m[B]^n
$$
- m: reaction order with respect to A
- n: reaction order with respect to B
- (m+n): overall reaction order
- m and n can be only determined experimentally

The differential form (that we have already learned):
1) The differential form (that we have already learned):
$$
Rate = k[A]^n or -\frac{\Delta[A]}{\Delta t} = k[A]^n
$$
Relationship between the rate of reaction and reactant concentration

2) The integrated form
$$
[A] = f(t) (or [A] = function of time)
$$
Relationship between the concentration of reaction reactant and time

Questions:
Can reaction order calculated non-experimentally? What is the underlying principles of reaction order.
