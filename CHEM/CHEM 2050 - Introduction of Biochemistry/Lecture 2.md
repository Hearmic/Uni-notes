### Titration Curves
An experiment in which measured amounts of base are added to an acid

Equivalence point: Point in an acid-base titration at which enough base 
$pK_a$ value would be the same as the pH of sthe olution where concentration of acid and base is 1:1

Buffer region: where the solution resists to change in pH![[Pasted image 20260107114217.png]]

### Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation
Mathematical relationship between the $pK_a$ of an acid and the pH of a solution containing both the acid and its conjugate base.

\[HA] and $[A^-]$ must be written 10x of each other
