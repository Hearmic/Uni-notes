### Titration Curves
An experiment in which measured amounts of base are added to an acid

Equivalence point: Point in an acid-base titration at which enough base 
$pK_a$ value would be the same as the pH of the olution where concentration of acid and base is 1:1

Buffer region: where the solution resists to change in pH![[Pasted image 20260107114217.png]]

### Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation
Mathematical relationship between the $pK_a$ of an acid and the pH of a solution containing both the acid and its conjugate base.

$log K_a = log [H^+] + log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$
$-log[H^+]  = -logK_a + log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$
$pH = pK_a + log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$

\[HA] and $[A^-]$ must be written 10x of each other


- When concentrations of a weak acid and its conjugate base are equal, the pH of the solution equals theh pKa of the wak acid
- pH versus 
  
  Question
  Calculate the relative amounts of acetic acid and acetate ion present at the following points when 1 mol of acetic acid is titrated with sodium hydroxide
  Also use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the values of the pH a these points
-   a. 0.1 mol of NaOH is added
-   b. 0.3 mol of NaOH is added
-   c. 0.5 mol of NaOH is added
  
  $$CH_3COOH + OH^- \to CH_3COO^- H_2O$$
  start: 1.0 mol $CH_3COOH \to$ 1.0 mol - 0.1 mol = 0.9 mol
