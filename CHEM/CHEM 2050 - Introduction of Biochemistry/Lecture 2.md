### Titration Curves
An experiment in which measured amounts of base are added to an acid

Equivalence point: Point in an acid-base titration at which enough base 
$pK_a$ value would be the same as the pH of the olution where concentration of acid and base is 1:1

Buffer region: where the solution resists to change in pH![[Pasted image 20260107114217.png]]

### Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation
Mathematical relationship between the $pK_a$ of an acid and the pH of a solution containing both the acid and its conjugate base.

$log K_a = log [H^+] + log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$
$-log[H^+]  = -logK_a + log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$
$pH = pK_a + log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$

\[HA] and $[A^-]$ must be written 10x of each other


- When concentrations of a weak acid and its conjugate base are equal, the pH of the solution equals theh pKa of the wak acid
- pH versus 
  
  Question
  Calculate the relative amounts of acetic acid and acetate ion present at the following points when 1 mol of acetic acid is titrated with sodium hydroxide
  Also use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the values of the pH a these points
-   a. 0.1 mol of NaOH is added
-   b. 0.3 mol of NaOH is added
-   c. 0.5 mol of NaOH is added
  
  $$CH_3COOH + OH^- \to CH_3COO^- H_2O$$
  start: 1.0 mol
- $CH_3COOH \to$ 1.0 mol - 0.1 mol = 0.9 mol (90% acedic acid)
- $CH_3COO^- \to$ 0 mol + 0.1 mol = 0.1 mol (10% its conjugate base)

$pH = pK_a + log(\frac{0.1 mol}{0.9 mol})$ = 3.81

pH 4.76 is when $pH = pK_a, log(\frac{0.5 mol}{0.5 mol}) = 0$

### Buffer Solutions
- Tend to resist change in pH when small to moderate amounts of a strong acid or strong base are added
- Consist of a weak acid and its conjugate base in roughly equal amounts
- Examples of acid -base buffers:
	 - $CH_3COOH, CH_3COONa$
	 - $NaHCO_3, Na_2CO_3$
	 - $NaH_2PO_4, Na_2HPO_4$

### Mechanism of Buffers - Example
- Consider a solution in which the concentrations are $[HPO_4^{2-}]$ = 0.053 M and 0.10 M
- If 1.0 mL of 0.10 M HCl is added to 99.0mL of the buffer, the following reaction takes place and almost all the added $H^+$ is used up
  
$$
HPO_4^{2-} + H^+ \to H_2PO_4^-
$$

$pK_a$ of $H_2PO_4^-$ = 7.20

### Buffer Selection
- Determined by understanding the relationship between pH and buffering capacity
- pH changes little in the vicinity of the inflection point of a titration curve (pH ~ pKa, $[HA]$ ~ $[A-]$)
- Buffer solutions can maintain a relativily constant pH value, which is met at values at or near the pKa of the acid
- Higher absolute concentrations give higher bugger capacities
  
- Suitable pKa
- No interference with the reaction or with the assay
- Suitable ionic strength of the buffer
- No precipitation of reactants or products due to the presence of the buffer
- Nonbiological nature of the buffer

Naturally Occurring Buffers
- Buffering system in blood is based on the dissociation of carbonic acid ($H_2CO_3$)
	- $pK_a$ = 6.37
	- $CO_2$ can dissolve in water and water-based fluids to produce carbonic acid
