## Fibrous Proteins
- Contain polypeptide chains organized approximately parallel along a single axis
- Consist of long fibers or large sheets
- Tend to be mechanically strong
- Insoluble in water
- Play important structural roles in nature
- Examples: Keratin in hair and wool, Collagen in connective tissue, including cartilage, bones, teeth, skin, and blood vessels.

### Globular Proteins
- Proteins in which the backbone folds on itself to produce a more or less spherical shape
- Most of their polar side chains are on the outside and interact with the aqueous environment by hydrogen bonding and ion-dipole interactions.
- Have substanital sections of $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-sheets
- Tend to be soluble in water and salt solutions
- have compact structures

## Tertiary Structure
- 3D arrangement of all atoms in a protein chain
- Includes the conformations of side chains and the positions of any ==prosthetic groups== (a molecule tightly to the protein that are required for its function)
- In globular proteins:
	- Tertiary structure helps determine the way helical and pleated-sheet sections fold back on each other
	- Interactions between side chains play an essential role in folding

### Forces Involved in
- H-bond between polar side chains of amino acids
- Hydrophobic effect (nonpolar side chains)
- Electrostatic attraction between side chains of opposite charge (salt-bridge, between $NH3^+$ and $COO^-$)
- Complexing several side chains to a single metal ion (ex: carbonic anhydraze)
- Disulfide bonds between side chains of cysteines
	- Restrict folding patterns available to polypeptide chains
	- Absent in myoglobin and hemoglobin but present in many other structures

### Myoglobin
- Consists of a single polypeptide chain of 153 amino acid residues and a prosthetic groups, heme, in a hydrophobic pocket
	- Heme: Iron-containing cyclic compound
- Carries eight $\alpha$-helical regions, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonding in the polypeptide backbone
- Exterior contains most of the polar side chains
- Interior contains non-polar side chains and two histidine residues that are involved in interactions with the heme group and bound $O_2$
- First protein to have its 3D structure completely solved with X-ray crystallography

### Heme group

  ![[Pasted image 20260121121019.png]]
- $O_2$ binds to the Iron (II) on the opposite side of His-93 (F8)
- His-64 (E7) is close to the bound $O_2$, weakens the binding geometry due to steric strain
- $O_2$ binds at a bent angle rather than in a linear fashion
- Oxygen and Carbon Monoxide Binding to the Heme Group of Myoglobin

## Denaturation
- Unraveling of the 3D structure of a macromolecule caused by the breakdown ov non-covalent and covalent interactions that can result from
	- Heat
	- Large changes in pH, which alter charges on side chians
	- Detergents, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
	- Chaotrophic agents, such as urea and guanidine hydrochloride, which disrupt hydrogen bonding
	  ![[Pasted image 20260121122802.png]]
	- $\beta$-mercaptoethanol, which reduces disulfide bonds


## Quaternary Structure of Proteins
- Pertains to proteins that consist of more than one polypeptide chain
	- Each chain is called a subunit
	- Entire protein could be called dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc.
	- Chains interact with one another noncovalently via electrostatic attractions, hydrogen bonds, and via the hydrophobic effect
- Conformational changes in one subunit can induce changes in other subunits (allostery)


### Hemoglobin
- Tetramer with:
	- Two $\alpha$-chains (141 residues long)
	- Two $\beta$-chains (146 residues long)
- Overall structure - $\alpha_2 \beta_2$
- Most amino acids of the alpha chain, beta chain, and myoglobin are homologous
