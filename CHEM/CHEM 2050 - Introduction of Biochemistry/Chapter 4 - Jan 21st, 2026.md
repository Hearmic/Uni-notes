## Fibrous Proteins
- Contain polypeptide chains organized approximately parallel along a single axis
- Consist of long fibers or large sheets
- Tend to be mechanically strong
- Insoluble in water
- Play important structural roles in nature
- Examples: Keratin in hair and wool, Collagen in connective tissue, including cartilage, bones, teeth, skin, and blood vessels.

### Globular Proteins
- Proteins in which the backbone folds on itself to produce a more or less spherical shape
- Most of their polar side chains are on the outside and interact with the aqueous environment by hydrogen bonding and ion-dipole interactions.
- Have substanital sections of $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-sheets
- Tend to be soluble in water and salt solutions
- have compact structures

## Tertiary Structure
- 3D arrangement of all atoms in a protein chain
- Includes the conformations of side chains and the positions of any ==prosthetic groups== (a molecule tightly to the protein that are required for its function)
- In globular proteins:
	- Tertiary structure helps determine the way helical and pleated-sheet sections fold back on each other
	- Interactions between side chains play an essential role in folding

### Forces Involved in
- H-bond between polar side chains of amino acids
- Hydrophobic effect (nonpolar side chains)
- Electrostatic attraction between side chains of opposite charge (salt-bridge, between $NH3^+$ and $COO^-$)
- Complexing several side chains to a single metal ion (ex: carbonic anhydraze)
- Disulfide bonds between side chains of cysteines
	- Restrict folding patterns available to polypeptide chains
	- Absent in myoglobin and hemoglobin but present in many other structures
