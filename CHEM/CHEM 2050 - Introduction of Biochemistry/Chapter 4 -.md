## Protein Structure
- Biologically active proteins are polymers that consitst of amoni acids linked by covalent peptide bonds
- Many conformatoins are possible for prteins due to flixibiity of amino acids
	- Naive conformations: 3-D shapes of proteins with biological activity
- Many proteins have large segments of random structure as they have no 

### Levels of Protein Structure
1. Primary Structure (1˚)" Order in which amino acids are covalently linked together
2. Secondary structure (2˚): Ordered 3-D arrangement in space of the backbone atoms 
3. Tertiary structure (3˚): 3-D arrangement of all atoms in a protein, including those in side chains and in prosthetic groups
4. Quaternary structure (4˚): Arrangement of subunits with respect to one another
	- Subunits: Individual parts of a large molecule

## Primary Structure
- Determines the 3-D conformation of the protein, which determines its properties
	- Determination of this sequence is a routine operation in classical biochemistry
- Changes in one amino acid residue in a sequence can alter biological functions 
	- Example - Hemoglobin associated with sickle-cell aneia
