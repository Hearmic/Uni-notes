## Protein Structure
- Biologically active proteins are polymers that consitst of amoni acids linked by covalent peptide bonds
- Many conformatoins are possible for prteins due to flixibiity of amino acids
	- Naive conformations: 3-D shapes of proteins with biological activity
- Many proteins have large segments of random structure as they have no 

### Levels of Protein Structure
1. Primary Structure (1˚)" Order in which amino acids are covalently linked together
2. Secondary structure (2˚): Ordered 3-D arrangement in space of the backbone atoms 
3. Tertiary structure (3˚): 3-D arrangement of all atoms in a protein, including those in side chains and in prosthetic groups
4. Quaternary structure (4˚): Arrangement of subunits with respect to one another
	- Subunits: Individual parts of a large molecule

## Primary Structure
- Determines the 3-D conformation of the protein, which determines its properties
	- Determination of this sequence is a routine operation in classical biochemistry
- Changes in one amino acid residue in a sequence can alter biological functions 
	- Example - Hemoglobin associated with sickle-cell anemia

### Secondary Structure
- Hydrogen-bonded arrangement of the polypeptide chain backbone
- Each amino acid residue has two bonds with free rotation that are designated by the angles phi ($\phi$) and psi ($\psi$)
	- $\phi$ : bond between the $\alpha$-carbon and amino nitrogen of that residue
	- $\psi$ : Bond between the $\alpha$-carbon and carboxyl carbon of that residue
- Ramachandran plot of phi ($\phi$) and psi ($\psi$) angles
- $\alpha$-helix
	- Stabilized by hydrogen bonds parallel to the chain direction within the backbone, all R groups point outward
	- Helix is right-handed (clockwise)
	- 3.6 residues per turn
	- Pitch: 5.4 A ($10^{-10}m$)
	- PDB example 1JRJ
- $\beta$-sheet
