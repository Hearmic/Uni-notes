### The behavior of Proteins: Enzymes
- Biological catalysts, usually globular proteins
- Increase the rate of a reaction by a factor of up to 10^20 over an uncatalyzed reaction
- Since enzymes are chiral, many reactions become enantioselective
- Fine-tuned by regulatory processes

### Thermodynamic principles - Enzyme Catalysis
- Standard free energy change ($\Delta$G˚): Difference between energyies of reactants and products under standard conditions
	- Enzymes can speed up reactions but cannot alter the equilibruium constant or the freee energy change
- Reaction rate depends on activation energy ($\Delta G˚$)
