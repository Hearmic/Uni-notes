### The behavior of Proteins: Enzymes
- Biological catalysts, usually globular proteins
- Increase the rate of a reaction by a factor of up to 10^20 over an uncatalyzed reaction
- Since enzymes are chiral, many reactions become enantioselective
- Fine-tuned by regulatory processes

### Thermodynamic Principles - Enzyme Catalysis
- Standard free energy change ($\Delta$G˚): Difference between energies of reactants and products under standard conditions (thermodynamic property)
	- Enzymes can speed up reactions, but cannot alter the equilibrium constant or the free energy change
- Reaction rate depends on activation energy ($\Delta G˚^{++}$), which is the energy input required to initiate a reaction (kinetic property)
	- $\Delta G˚^{++}$ The activation energy for an uncatalyzed reaction is higher than that for a catalyzed reaction
- For a reaction taking place at constant temperature and pressure, the change in free energy is given by the following expression:
$$\Delta Gˆ= \Delta H˚ - T\Delta S˚$$
- Change in free energy is related to the equilibrium constant $K_{eq}$
$$\Delta G˚ = -RT\ ln K_{eq}$$
	If $\Delta G˚$ is (-), K>1
	If $\Delta G˚$ is (+), K<1

### The transition state
- Maximum of curve connecting the reactants and products
- $\Delta G˚$ of a reaction remains unchanged when a catalyst is added, but $\Delta G˚^{++}$ is 

### Effect of Catalysts on Activation Energy
- $\Delta G˚^{++}$ is lowered if the reaction is allowed to proceed on platinum surfaces ,but is lowered even more by enzyme catalase

| Reaction Conditions | kJ mol^-1 | Relative rate |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
|                     |           | 1             |
|                     |           | 10^4          |
|                     |           | 10^8          |

### Temperature Dependence of Catalysis
- Increasing the temperature of a reaction mixture will increase the energy available to the reactants to reach the transition state
- Occurs only to a limited extent with biochemical reactions because increasing temperature will eventually lead to enzyme denaturation

### Enzyme-Substrate Binding
- In an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, substrate (S) is a reactant
- Active site: Portion of the enzyme surface to which the substrate binds via noncovalent interactions and at which the reaction takes place
- First step is binding of substrate to the enzyme, described by the lock and key model (outdated), or the induced-fit model (modern)
- Despite of its specificity, enzyme can bind to multiple, similar substrates with conformation change
- Enzyme and substrate must bind to form the ES complex before the overall reaction takes place: E + S $\leftrightarrow$ ES

### Michaelis-Menten Approach to Enzyme Kinetics
$$E + S \leftrightarrow ES \to E + P$$
- Usually $k_2$ is usually much smaller than $k_1, k_{-1}$ 
$$V_0 = \frac{k_2 [E]_T [S]}{K_M + }$$
