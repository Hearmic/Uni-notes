## The importance of Energy Changes and Electron Transfer in Metabolism
### Standard Free-Energy Changes
- Standard state for solutes - 1M concentration
- $\Delta G˚$ is the standard free energy change, meaning all reactants and products are at standard state conditions
- At all other conditions, $\Delta G$ can be calculated as follows (at non- standard state.
  $$\Delta G = \Delta G˚+ RT\ lnQ$$
- When all compounds in is 1M
	- If $\Delta G$˚ > 0 reaction proceeds to the left
	- If $\Delta G$˚ < 0 reaction proceeds to the right
- R = 8.314 J mol^-1K^-1
- Law of mass action
$$Q = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$$
$$\Delta G˚ = -RT\ lnK$$
- $\Delta G$ = 0 at equilibrium (0 = $\Delta G˚ + RT\ lnK$)

### Modified Standard State for Biochemical Applications
- Standard free energy change $\Delta G˚$
