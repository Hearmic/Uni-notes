## The importance of Energy Changes and Electron Transfer in Metabolism
### Standard Free-Energy Changes
- Standard state for solutes - 1M concentration
- $\Delta G˚$ is the standard free energy change, meaning all reactants and products are at standard state conditions
- At all other conditions, $\Delta G$ can be calculated as follows (at non- standard state.
  $$\Delta G = \Delta G˚+ RT\ lnQ$$
- If $\Delta G$˚ > 0
