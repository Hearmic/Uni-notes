## The importance of Energy Changes and Electron Transfer in Metabolism
### Standard Free-Energy Changes
- Standard state for solutes - 1M concentration
- $\Delta G˚$ is the standard free energy change, meaning all reactants and products are at standard state conditions
- At all other conditions, $\Delta G$ can be calculated as follows (at non- standard state.
  $$\Delta G = \Delta G˚+ RT\ lnQ$$
- When all compounds in is 1M
	- If $\Delta G$˚ > 0 reaction proceeds to the left
	- If $\Delta G$˚ < 0 reaction proceeds to the right
- R = 8.314 J mol^-1K^-1
- Law of mass action
$$Q = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$$
$$\Delta G˚ = -RT\ lnK$$
- $\Delta G$ = 0 at equilibrium (0 = $\Delta G˚ + RT\ lnK$)

### Modified Standard State for Biochemical Applications
- Standard free energy change $\Delta G˚$ assumes a concentration of 1M for all solutes
- If $[H^+]$ = 1M, then pH = 0, not physiologically relevant
- Biochemical reactions are defined by a modified standard state which assumes $[H^+]$ = 10^-7M (pH 7.0)
- Modified standard state for free-energy change is given the symbol $\Delta G˚'$

- If $\Delta G˚'$ is related to the K'
- Example: hydrolysis of ATP at pH 7
$$ATP_{(aq)} + H_2O \leftrightarrow ADP_{(aq)} + {P_i}_{(aq)} + H^+_P{(aq)}$$
### Spontaneity
- Spontaneous reactions (exergonic) occur without added energy, releases energy
- Non-spontaneous reactions (endergonic) can proceed if they are coupled to energy-releasing reactions such that the overall process releases energy
- $C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \to 6CO_2 + 6H_2O  (\Delta G˚' << 0)$
- $6CO_2 + 6H_2O \to C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2\ (\Delta G˚' >> 0)$
### Driving Endergonic Reactions
- Examples of reaction coupling
### Metabolism
- Sum total of the chemical reactions of biomolecules in an organism
- Catabolism (oxidative process that releases energy)
- Anabolism (reductive process that requires energy)

### Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) Reactions
- Electron transfer reactions
- Oxidation states (numbers) can help determine which atoms are being oxidized/reduced in a redox reaction
- Oxidation is loss of electrons (ex: loss of hydrogen atoms)
- Reduction is gain of electrons (ex: gain of hydrogen atoms)
- First-year example: assigning oxidation states to the atoms in ethanol
	- $C_2H_6O$ (C: -2, H: +6, O: -2)
- Half reaction of oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde using alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)

### Coenzymes - NAD 
- Coenzyme - an organic molecule loosely bound to an enzyme to facilitate the catalyzed reaction
- Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) exists in two forms
	- NAD+ (oxidized form)
	- NADH (reduced form)
- Biological redox reactions often involve electron transfer from a substrate to NAD+

- When ADH oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde, NAD+ is reduced to NADH 
- NAD+ takes 2 electrons and 1 proton to form NADH with 1 proton leftover
