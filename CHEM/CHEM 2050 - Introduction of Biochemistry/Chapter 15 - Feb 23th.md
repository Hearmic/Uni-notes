### ATP
- Phosphoric anhydride linkages
- Breaking these bonds itself requires energy (Hydrolysis of ATP requires an analysis of both reactant and all products)
$$ATP^{4-} + H_2O \to ADP^{3-} + HPO_4^{2-} + H^+$$
- Inorganic phosphate is stabilized by resonance
- Decrease in electrostatic repulsion upon hydrolysis of ATP to ADP
- Overall, ATP ATP hydrolysis is highly favorable: $\Delta G˚' = -30.5\ kJ/mol$


| Compound             | $\Delta G˚'$ (kJ/mol^-1) |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Phosphoenolpyruvate  | -61.9                    |
| Carbamoyl phosphate  | -51.4                    |
| Creatine phosphate   | -43.1                    |
| Acetyl phosphate     | -42.2                    |
| ATP (to ADP)         | -30.5                    |
| Glucose-1-phosphate  | -20.9                    |
| Glucose-6-phosphate  | -12.5                    |
| Glycerol-3-phosphate | -9.7                     |
|                      |                          |
- $Glucose + ATP \to Glucose-6-phosphate + ADP\ (\Delta G˚'=-18 kJ/mol)$
- Compounds above ATP can directly synthesize ATP by substrate leevel phosphorylation ($Phosphoenolpyruvate + ADP \to Pyruvate + ATP$)


### Coenzyme A

- Not redox activating
- act as a carrier of acyl groups by forming highly activated 
- $CoA-SH \to CoA-S-C(=O)-R$ 
- If R = CH3, called Acetyl-CoA
- Hydrolysis of Acetyl-CoA (Product Acetate is stabilized by resonance)
- Acetyl-CoA + H_2O -> CoA + Acetic Acid (G˚' << -31.4kJ/mol)
- Oxaloacetate + Acetic Acid -> Citrate + H_2O (G˚' > 0)
- AcetylCoA + oxaloacetate -> CoA + Citrate (G˚' < 0) (Overall)

## Chapter 16 - Carbohydrates

- Polyhydroxy aldehydes or polyhydroxy ketones or polymers that can be hydrolyzed to them
- Monosaccharides:
	- Compounds that contain a single carbonyll group and two or more hydroxyl groups
	- Cannot be hydrolyzed to simpler carbohydrates
	- Have the general formula $C_n(H_2O)_n$
- Oligosaccharides and Polysaccharides
	- Sugars linked by glycosidic bonds
	- Formed when two or more monosaccharides are bonded together

### Oligosaccharides

- Play a key role in process that take place on the surfaces of cells, such as cell-cell 

### Polysaccharides
- Energy Storage
- Essential structural components of several classes of organisms
- Wood, Cell Wall of plants are composed of celluose

### Monosaccharides
- Building blocks of all carbohydrates, major energy source for life
- Aldose/Ketose: Monosaccharide containing an aldehyde/ketone group as part of its structure
- Triose - Simplest monosaccharide that contains three carbon atoms 

### Trioses 
![[Pasted image 20260223123601.png]]
- Dihydroxyacetone (achiral)
- Glyceraldehyde (chiral)
- D- and L-glyceraldehyde are enantiomers (L-glyceraldehyde is generally considered not to occur in nature)


### Fischer Projections
- Convention for monosaccharides - most oxidized carbon as close to the top as possible, "top" carbon labelled C1
- D/L configuration assigned from the highest numbered chiral carbon (-OH bonded to right: D)
- Rotate Ficscher 180˚ is allowed

### Aldotetroses
- Contain two chiral carbons, C-2 and C-3, with four possible stereoisomers
- Two naturally occurring

- The highest number chiral carbon whose OH group pointing right is considered
