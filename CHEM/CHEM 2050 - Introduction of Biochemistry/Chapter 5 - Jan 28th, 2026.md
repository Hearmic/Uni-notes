- Process in which ruptured cells are centrifuged several times increaseing the force of gravity each time

### Salting Out
- Purification technique for proteins based on differential solubility in salt solutions
	- Dependent on overall charge, ionic strength, and polarity
- Ammonium sulfate $(NH_4)_2SO_4$ is used in the process
	- Takes away water by interacting with it and makes protein less soluble because hydrophobic interactions among proteins increase
- Different aliquots are. taken as function of salt concentration ot get closer to desired protein sample
	- One fraction has the protein of interest

### Chromatography
- Based on the fact that different compounds distribute themselves to varying extents between different phases, or separable portions of matter
- Stationary phase: Substance that selectively retards the flow of the sample, effecting the separation
- Mobile phase: Portion of the system in which the mixture to be separated moves
- Column chromatography: Form of chromatography in which the stationary phase is packed in a column

### Column Chromatography
![[Pasted image 20260128114539.png]]
-  Reservoir containing the eluent (the mobile phase)
- Column packed with stationary phase in contact with eluent throughout its length
- As the eluent flows through the column, compounds of the sample migrate at different rates
- Three zones are being separated Elution continues
- The fastest moving substance eluted from column
- Eluent is collected manually or automatically and analyzed for the presence (and sometimes the amount) of solute

### Size-Exclusion, or Gel-Filtration Chromatography
- Technique used to separate biomolecules based on size (agarose or dextran)
- Stationary phase consists of cross-linked gel particles
- Extent of cross-linking can be controlled to determine pore size
	- Smaller molecules enter the proes and are delayed in elution time
	- Larger molecules do not enter the pores and elute from the column before the smaller ones

### Affinity Chromatography
- Powerful column separation procedure based on specific binding of proteins to a ligand

### Ion-exchange chromatography
Method of separating substances on the basis of charge
- Cation/Anion exchanger: Resin that has a net negative/positive charge and binds to positively/negatively charged molecules flowing through it
![[Pasted image 20260128123458.png]]
- Modifying pH change the charge of protein, thus which protein will interact and delay elusion.
- pI : Isoelectric point
	- **pH < pI:** The molecule is positively charged (cationic).
	- **pH = pI:** The molecule is neutral (zwitterion).
	- **pH > pI:** The molecule is negatively charged (anionic).

### Electrophoresis
- Method for separating macromolecule (DNA, proteins)
- Macromolecules have differing mobilities in an electric field based on their charge, shape, and size
- Thin porous ==polyacrylamide== slab is used as gel media
- Protein mixture loaded into the gel, which is suspended in an aqueous buffer 
- Voltage is applied across the gel which causes proteins to migrate through the gel at different rates depending on their charges and sizes
- Analytical Technique rather than purification

### SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
- Electrophoretic technique that separates proteins on the basis of size only
- Protein is treated with the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) before it is applied to the gel, provides a uniform "coat" of negative charge
- Smaller proteins move faster through the gel 
- The longer the protein, more SDS molecules surround, thus more overall negative charge
- $\beta$-mercaptoethanol often added (ensure breaking disulfide bridge)
