### Amino Acids Are Three-Dimensional
- alpha carbon Bonded to a hydrogen and to the side chain group, R
	- Side chain group: Portion of an amino acid that determines its identity
- Two stereoisomers of amino acids are designated as L- and D- amino acids based on similarity to glyceraldehyde
	- Stereoisomers: Molecules that differ from each other only in their configuration


$d/l$ system: Optimal Lights

**D/L (relative)**, used mainly for sugars/amino acids, refers to configuration relative to glyceraldehyde (OH on the right for D, left for L in Fischer projections), 

while 

**R/S (absolute)**, using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, defines the precise 3D arrangement around a chiral center (clockwise=R, counter-clockwise=S), applicable to any chiral molecule and more specific

### Structure and Properties of Amino Acids
- With the exception of glycine, all amino acids are at least one chiral center (the alpha carbon) and are chiral (stereoisomers)
	- Vast majority of a- amino acids have the L configuration at the $\alpha$-carbon

#### Nonpolar Amino Acids
- nonpolar side chains
- Glycine, Alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine
- Tryptophan has a aromatic, indole side chain

#### Polar Amino Acids
- Polar side chains that are electrically neutral at neutral pH
- Threonine (Thr, T), Serine (Ser, S), Cysteine (Cys, C), Asparagine (Asn, N), Tyrosine (Tyr, Y), Glutamine (Gln, Q)
- In serine and threonine, thepolar gorup is a hydroxyl bonded to an aliphatic group

#### Acid Amino Acids
- Gluamic Acid (Asp, D) and Aspartic Acid (Glu, E)
- Glutamate/Aspartate (conjugate base of Glutamic Acid/Aspartic Acid)
- Have carboxyl groups in their side chains in addition to the one present in all amino acids
	- Carboxyl group can lose a proton, forming carboxylate anions
	- Side chains are negatively charged at neutral pH

#### Basic Amino Acids
- Histidine (His, H), Lysine (Lys, K), Arginine Arg, R)
- Histidine 
	- has an ==imidazole ring== (pentagon shape with two Ns in it)
	- 50% Protonated at pH = 6.0 ($pK_a$ = 6.0)
	- 90% Protonated at pH = 7.0
- Lysine
	- 50% Protonated at pH = 10.5 ($pK_a$ = 10.5)
- Arginine
	- has Guanidiniuan Group
	- 50% Protonated at pH = 12.5 ($pK_a$ = 12.5)
