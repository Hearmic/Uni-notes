### Amino Acids Are Three-Dimensional
- alpha carbon Bonded to a hydrogen and to the side chain group, R
	- Side chain group: Portion of an amino acid that determines its identity
- Two stereoisomers of amino acids are designated as L- and D- amino acids based on similarity to glyceraldehyde
	- Stereoisomers: Molecules that differ from each other only in their configuration


$d/l$ system: Optimal Lights

**D/L (relative)**, used mainly for sugars/amino acids, refers to configuration relative to glyceraldehyde (OH on the right for D, left for L in Fischer projections), 

while 

**R/S (absolute)**, using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, defines the precise 3D arrangement around a chiral center (clockwise=R, counter-clockwise=S), applicable to any chiral molecule and more specific

### Structure and Properties of Amino Acids
- With the exception of glycine, all amino acids are at least one chiral center (the alpha carbon) and are chiral (stereoisomers)
	- Vast majority of a- amino acids have the L configuration at the alpha
