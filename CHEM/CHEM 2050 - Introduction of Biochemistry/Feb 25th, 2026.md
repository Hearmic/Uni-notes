## Disaccharides
- Monosaccharides can react with each other to form glycosidic linkages
- The hemiacetal OH group on one cyclic sugar reacts with an OH group  on the other sugar to form an acetal group
- The sugar residue with the acetal linkage can no longer equilibrate with the open-chain form unless hydrolyzed

### Maltose
- Disaccharide, frome
- alpha-D-glucopyranose hemiacetal (C1) OH forms an acetal linkage with C4 OH 
- free hemiacetal group is still in equilibrium with its open chain form aldehyde, hence a reducing sugar
