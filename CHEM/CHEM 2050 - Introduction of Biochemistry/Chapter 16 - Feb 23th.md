### ATP
- Phosphoric anhydride linkages
- Breaking these bonds itself requires energy (Hydrolysis of ATP requires an analysis of both reactant and all products)
$$ATP^{4-} + H_2O \to ADP^{3-} + HPO_4^{2-} + H^+$$
- Inorganic phosphate is stabilized by resonance
- Decrease in electrostatic repulsion upon hydrolysis of ATP to ADP
- Overall, ATP ATP hydrolysis is highly favorable: $\Delta G˚' = -30.5\ kJ/mol$
