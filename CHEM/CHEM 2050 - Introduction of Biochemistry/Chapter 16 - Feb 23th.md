### ATP
- Phosphoric anhydride linkages
- Breaking these bonds itself requires energy (Hydrolysis of ATP requires an analysis of both reactant and all products)
$$ATP^{4-} + H_2O \to ADP^{3-} + HPO_4^{2-} + H^+$$
- Inorganic phosphate is stabilized by resonance
- Decrease in electrostatic repulsion upon hydrolysis of ATP to ADP
- Overall, ATP ATP hydrolysis is highly favorable: $\Delta G˚' = -30.5\ kJ/mol$


| Compound             | $\Delta G˚'$ (kJ/mol^-1) |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Phosphoenolpyruvate  | -61.9                    |
| Carbamoyl phosphate  | -51.4                    |
| Creatine phosphate   | -43.1                    |
| Acetyl phosphate     | -42.2                    |
| ATP (to ADP)         | -30.5                    |
| Glucose-1-phosphate  | -20.9                    |
| Glucose-6-phosphate  | -12.5                    |
| Glycerol-3-phosphate | -9.7                     |
|                      |                          |
- $Glucose + ATP \to Glucose-6-phosphate + ADP\ (\Delta G˚'=-18 kJ/mol)$
- Compounds above ATP can directly synthesize ATP by substrate leevel phosphorylation ($Phosphoenolpyruvate + ADP \to Pyruvate + ATP$)


### Coenzyme A

- Not redox activating
- act as a acyl group 
- $CoA-SH \to CoA-S-C(=O)-R$
