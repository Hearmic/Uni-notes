### Rate $[S] = K_M$ 

$$V_0 = \frac{k_2\ [E]_T [S]}{K_M + [S]} = \frac{V_{max} [S]}{[S] + [S]} = \frac{1}{2}\ V_{max}$$

- $k_2 = k_{cat}$ and is the turnover number (# mol of substrate that can be converted to product per mol of enzyme per second)
- The enzyme is saturated with substrate (at $V_{max}$)
- When [S] is high, $V = V_{max} = k_{cat}[E]T$ 
  $$k_{cat} = \frac{V_{max}}{[E]_T}$$
$$\frac{k_{cat}}{K_M}$$
- High $k_{cat}$, and low $K_M$ lead to faster reaction

### Enzyme Activity and Specific Activity
- Enzyme activity and specific activity are different from MM kinetic parameters
- Enzyme activity is the number of micromoles of substrate that get converted to product per minute (depends on amount of substrate present), has units of U
  ($V_0\ \micro mol/minute)$
- Specific enzyme activity is enzyme activity per mg of total protein present

$$\frac{1}{V} = \frac{K_M + [S]}{V_{max}[S]} = \frac{K_M}{V_{max}}\frac{1}{[S]} + \frac{[S]}{[S]V_{max}} = mx + b$$
### Lineweaver-Burk Plot
- Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plot gives the: 
	- Slop of the line, m, which equals $\frac{K_M}{V_{max}}$
	- y intercept, b, which equals $\frac{1}{V_{max}}$
	- x intercept, which equals $-\frac{1}{K_M}$

## Inhibitors
$$\frac{1}{V} = \frac{K_M}{V_{max}}(1 + \frac{[I]}{K_I})\frac{1}{[S]}$$
- Substances that decrease the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction
- Reversible inhibitors
	- Substances that bind to an enzyme and subsequently are released without reaction
	- Include competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibitors
	- Mode of action of many pharmaceuticals
- Irreversible inhibitors
	- Substances that react with enzymes to produce proteins that are not enzymatically active and from which originial enzymes cannot be regenerated 
	- Mode of action of many poisons

### Competitive Inhibition
- Decrease in enzymatic activity caused by binding of a substrate analogue to the active (catalytic) site
- Inhibitor competes with the substrate for the active site on the enzyme
$$E + S \leftrightarrow ES,\ \ E + I \leftrightarrow EI$$
- Equilibrium expression for the breakdown of the enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI) is given by
$$K_I = \frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}$$
