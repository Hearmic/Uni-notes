### Rate $[S] = K_M$ 

$$V_0 = \frac{k_2\ [E]_T [S]}{K_M + [S]} = \frac{V_{max} [S]}{[S] + [S]} = \frac{1}{2}\ V_{max}$$

- $k_2 = k_{cat}$ and is the turnover number (# mol of substrate that can be converted to product per mol of enzyme per second)
- The enzyme is saturated with substrate (at $V_{max}$)
- When [S] is high, $V = V_{max} = k_{cat}[E]T$ 
  $$k_{cat} = \frac{V_{max}}{[E]_T}$$
$$\frac{k_{cat}}{K_M}$$
- High $k_{cat}$, and low $K_M$ lead to faster reaction

### Enzyme Activity and Specific Activity
- Enzyme activity and specific activity are different from MM kinetic parameters
- Enzyme activity is the number of micromoles of substrate that get converted to product per minute (depends on amount of substrate present), has units of U
  ($V_0\ \micro mol/minute)$
- Specific enzyme activity is enzyme activity per mg of total protein present

$$\frac{1}{V} = \frac{K_M + [S]}{V_{max}[S]} = \frac{K_M}{V_{max}}\frac{1}{[S]} + $$
