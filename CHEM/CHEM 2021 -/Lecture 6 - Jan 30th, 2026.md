### 
- Cyclic, conjugated
- Unusally stable, having a heat of hydrogenation 150kJ/mol


## Criteria for Aromaticity
- Possess a cyclic structure
- Fully conjugated (possess a p orbital on all participating ring)
- Exhbits planarity of the conjuated cycle (planar ring)
- Have 4n+2 $\pi$ electrons delocalized in the ring, where n is an integer value (Huckel's rule)
In general, when one (or more) of these criteria are not fullfilled, it can be either non-aromatic or anti-aromatic.
