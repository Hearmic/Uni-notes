The initial idea is that a matter has a wave property


The central equation of QM is a differential equation
Matter is described by mathematical equations called wavefunctions
Particles only exist in certain quantized energy states E
The symbol ^ denotes an operator

Stationary Wave: Nodes are fixed

### E. Postulates of Quantum Mechanics

#### QM Postulate 1: Wavefunctions and Probability
a) The state of a quantum-mechanical system is completely specified by a function ψ(x,t) that depends on the coordinates of the particle and on time

#### Requirements
1. continuous ψ defined all x in the stated interval
2. Bounded ψ cannot be ∞ or -∞ in the interval (x values
3. Single-valued ψ has one value for each x
4. dψ/dx must be defined for all x in the interval

b) this function, called the wavefunction, has the important property that ψ(x, t)ψ(x, t)
