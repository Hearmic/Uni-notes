## Lecture 5 - Biochemical Energy Generation and Utilization
### Spontaneity is determined by Gibbs Free Energy:
$\Delta H - T \Delta S <= 0$

- Formulated by J. Willard in 1878
- The change in free energy for a process is $\Delta G$
- Consequently, spontaneous processes at constant temperature and pressure have negative $\Delta G$
- Negative $\Delta G$ values ($\Delta G$ < 0) are said to be exergonic (Greek: ergon, work)
- Positive $\Delta G$ values ($\Delta G$ > 0) are said to be endergonic; they must be driven by the input of free energy
