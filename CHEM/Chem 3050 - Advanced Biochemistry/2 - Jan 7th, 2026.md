Class 1: Retrotransposons (copy & paste) DNA -> RNA -> DNA (reverse transcription) 
Class 2: DNA transposons (cut & paste) DNA -> DNA (in different)
Molecular parasite (they exist to exist) 
A huge part of the human genome 

Simple Selfish Genes? Not sure
- Diversifying Genome (as it moves DNA here and there)
1. Neuronal Cells (have a higher order of diversity)
2. Early embryo development
3. Cancer (upregulated)

5' cap, Poly-A-tail
- Nuclear Export, Prevents Degradation, Recognized by the Ribosome
- No introns, Polycistronic (many proteins in one mRNA)
- Riboswitches: RNA with secondary structure, Changes shape when binding to a metabolite $\to$ lead to comnormational change, either black or reveal important seqeunces. (RBS)
