### 
$$\Delta G = \Delta G˚ + RT\ ln\ Q$$
#### Making reactions occur spontaneously
$\Delta G$ values are dependent on the concentrations of reactants and products
Thus, reducing the amount of products present within a cell helps drive a reaction forward.

### Thermodynamically unfavorable reactions can be driven by a favorable reaction
- ATP hydrolysis

### Glycolysis
Aerobic glycolysis (Glucose -> Pyruvate -> CO2)
Anaerobic glycolysis (Glucose -> Pyruvate -> Ethanol/Lactate)

#### Step 1: Glucose -> Glucose-6-phosphate
- Hexokinase with $Mg^{2+}$
- Uses ATP to phosphorylate Glucose
- No longer leave the cell
	- cannot diffuse
	- cannot interact with the transporter
#### Step 2: Glucose-6-phosphate -> Fructose-6-phosphate
- Phosphoglucose Isomerase
- Prepare to split sugar into two 3-carbon molecules
#### Step 3: Fructose-6-phosphate -> Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
- Phosphofructokinase-1
	- key rate-limiting enzyme
	- more active when ATP is high
	- end point inhibition (ATP bind to the allosteric site (decrease affinity for F6P; lower catalytic rate)
- $Mg^{2+}$
- When energy is abundant, prevent unnecessary glucose breakdown
#### Step 4: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate -> Dihydroxyacetone phosphate, Gluceraldehyde-3-phosphate
- Fructose Biophosphate Aldolase
#### Step 5: DHAP -> G3P
- Enzyme: Triose phosphate isomerase
#### Step 6: G3P -> 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate
- Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
- $NAD^+ + P_i \to NADH + H^+$
- Oxidize sugar; make NADH
- Regulated by $NAD^+$ (Indicator for how much energy present in the cell)
#### Step 7: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate -> 3-phosphoglycerate
- Enzyme: 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, $Mg^{2+}$
-  Substrate-level phosphorylation (ADP is made directly using high energy bond of another molecule)
#### Step 8: 3-phosphoglycerate -> 2-phosphoglycerate
- Enzyme: Phosphoglycerate Mutase (Isomerase)
#### Step 9: 2-phosphoglycerate -> Phosphenolpyruvate (PEP)
- Enzyme: Enolase
- Dehydration (Removing Water)
#### Step 10: PEP -> Pyruvate
- Enzyme: Pyruvate Kinase (rate-limiting enzyme), $Mg^{2+}$
