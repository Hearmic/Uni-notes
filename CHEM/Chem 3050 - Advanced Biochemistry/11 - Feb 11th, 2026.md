### 
$$\Delta G = \Delta G˚ + RT\ ln\ Q$$
#### Making reactions occur spontaneously
$\Delta G$ values are dependent on the concentrations of reactants and products
Thus, reducing the amount of products present within a cell helps drive a reaction forward.

### Thermodynamically unfavorable reactions can be driven by a favorable reaction
- ATP hydrolysis

### Glycolysis
Aerobic glycolysis (Glucose -> Pyruvate -> CO2)
Anaerobic glycolysis (Glucose -> Pyruvate -> Ethanol/Lactate)

#### Step 1: Glucose -> Glucose-6-phosphate
- Hexokinase with Mg+
- Uses ATP to phosphorylate Glucose
- No longer leave the cell
	- cannot diffuse
	- cannot interact with the transporter
#### Step 2: Glucose-6-phosphate -> Fructose-6-phosphate
- Phosphoglucose Isomerase
- Prepare to split sugar into two 3 carbon molecules

#### Step 3: Fructose-6-phosphate -> Fructose-1,6,-bisphosphate
- Phosphofructokinase-1, $Mg^{2+}$
