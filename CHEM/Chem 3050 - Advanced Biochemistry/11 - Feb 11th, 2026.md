### Glycolysis
$$\Delta G = \Delta G˚ + RT\ ln\ Q$$
#### Making reactions occur spontaneously
$\Delta G$ values are dependent on the concentrations of reactants and products
Thus, reducing the amount of products present within a cell helps drive a reaction forward.

### Thermodynamically unfavorable reactions can be driven by a favorable reaction
- ATP hydrolysis
