### Allosteric Regulation of Hemoglobin
### Physiological Conditions
- Maximize O2 unloading in tissues & loading in lungs

- Case 1 exercise CO2 up, [H+] up -> promote Hb release O2
- Case decay Hb -> lung -> pick up $O_2$ -> make $H^+$ -> promote $CO_2$ -> exhale $CO_2$

$$CO_2 + H_2O \to Carbonic Acid\ (with\ Carbonic\ anhydrase)$$
$$and O_2Hb + H^+ \to [H^+]DeoxyHb + O_2$$
$O_2Hb$: Weaker base
DeoxyHb: Stronger Base
The same side chains of Hb act as a buffer
