#### Chymotrypsin Active Site

### Protease
- Aminopeptidases: Cleave at amino terminal
- Carboxypeptidases Cleave carboxy terminal residue
- Endopeptidases: Cleave middle

#### Serine Proteases
- Chymotrypsin $\leftrightarrow$ Subtillsin,  (convergent evolution) (Ser - His -Asp catalytic triad)
- Chymotrypsin, Subtillsin, Elastase share similar function
- But diverge in protein substrates
- Recognize different R group
	- Trypsin: Asp side chain stabilized by Lys
	- Chymotrypsin: hydrophobic pocket (non-polar R group aromatic)
	- Elastase: smaller binding site (Only arrow alanine, due to bulky group in the pocket)
### Kinases
- NMP Kinases: Transfer $PO_4$ from NTP to NMP -> form NDP
- Adenylate Kinase (AK): ADP + ADP $\to$ AMP + ATP
- Relay system btw mitochondrial/cytoplasmic poals of ATP
- Sensor for energy load (AMP-sensors)
	- AMPK
	- K-ATP
	- AMP-sensitive metabollic enzymes
	- Adenosine
- AK isoforms
	- Different tissue/subcellular localization
	- different kinetics
	- Nuc. preference
	- Some only work on ATP
	- other GTP/CTP/UTP
	- AK7: cytosol exclusive - skeletal muscle
	- AK8: cytosol exclusive - non-skeletal muscle
	- AK1: Most abuundant cytoplasmic AK ($K_H$ 1000% higher than AKK7/8)

### Types of Catalytic Mechanisms
- Covalent 
- Acid-Base
- Electrostatic
	- Occurs when the enzyme active site stabilizes the transition state of the reaction by forming electrostatic interactions with the substrate. The electrostatic interactions can be ionic, ionic-dipole, dipole-dipole, or hydrophobic interactions. H-bonding is one of the most common electrostatic interactions formed 
- Desolvation
- Catalysis by Approximation
	- Occurs when enzyme bind to close proximity
- Strain Distortion
- Cofactor 

#### Adenylate Kinase Reaction
- Lid Domain (like a cap which can close/open)
- Cause water exclusion
- Bring substrate close together
- Cofactor Mg/Mn
- Good at coordinating negative charge of nucleotide
- Increase electrophilicity of AMP phosphate
- Held by electrostatic interaction
- Dissociate very easily
