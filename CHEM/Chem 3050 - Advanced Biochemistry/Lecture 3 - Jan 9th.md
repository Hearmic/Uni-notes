Proteins are made of $\alpha$-Amino Acids

20 Major Amino Acids
Two major categories based on R-groups:
- Nonpolar (Hydrophobic Amino acids)
	- Aliphatic Amino Acids (Branched Chain)
	- Aromatic Amino Acids (contain a phenyl Ring)
	- Met and Pro
- Polar 
	- Polar Uncharged (can carry )
	- Acidic Amino Acids (carry positive charge)
	- Basic Amino Acids (carry negative charge)

### Nonpolar

#### Aliphatic Amino Acids
 - 

#### Aromatic
- Phe F
- Tyr, Y
- Trp, W
#### Special
- Proline (Pro, P): Ring Structure, Destabilizes 2nd structure
- Methionine (Met, M)

### Polar Uncharged Amino Acids
Carry Permanant Dipole
- Cysteine (Cys, C)
- Serine (Ser, S)
- Threonine (Thr, T)
- Asparagine (Asn, N)
- Glutamine (Gln, Q)

### Polar Acidic Acids
- Aspartic Acid (Asp, D)
- Glutamic Acid (Glu, E)

### Polar Basic Amino Acids
Potential to be a positive charge
- Arginine (Arg, R)
- Lysine (Lys, K)
- Histidine (His, H)

$\alpha$-Amino Acids are Chiral
L-Alanine (Natural) vs D-Alanine
- Correspond to the R and S configuration

Amino Acids are ==Zwitterions==:
- A molecule having two or more functional groups, both positive and negative, but neutral net charge at specific pH (Isoelectric point)

### Isoelectric Points (pl's) and $pK_a$'s
- The isoelectric point of a molecule or a protein can be determined by evaluating all of the acid dissociation constants (pKa values) for functional groups that can carry charges within the molecule
- The pKa value indicates the strength of an acid (or the ability of a functional group to donate a proton to the surrounding medium)
- The lower the $pK_a$, the stronger the acid

$pK_a$ can shift depending on the environment

The peptide bond is an Amide

- Directionality of peptide bond synthesis (ribosomal)
  N-terminus: starting point
  C-terminus: elongated through a peptide bond
- R groups are bulky, reducing sterics by making a trans conformation (except Proline which prefer to have cis- conformation, useful for bending peptide structure)
- The amide bond is planar

### Level of Structures
#### Primary
- 1D

#### Secondary 
Favorable $p_{hi}$ or $p_{si}$ angle
Local structure
R group not involved with H-bonding but affect bkrics
- $\alpha$-Helix: 
	- The core of the helix is tightly packed
	- more compact than the fully extended polypeptide chain with phi/psi angles of 180 degree
	- the average number of amino acids in a helix is 11, which gives 3 turns) 
	- The Left-handed helix is rare
	- The R-group face outside of the helix
	- influence folding
		- hydrophobic - head fold inside the protein shielded, span plasma membrane
		- Hydrophilic - span water environment
- $\beta$-sheet
	- jj
 
 #### Tertiary 
- Disulfide Bridges (two Cystine residues, not spontaneous, enzyme required)
