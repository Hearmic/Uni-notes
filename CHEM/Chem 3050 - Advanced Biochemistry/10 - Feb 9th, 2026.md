Intercalating agents cause covalent modification of certain nucleobases due to pi- stacking

Which amino acid is the most likely to be abundant in histone proteins
Lysine (positively charged)

Purines contain more nitrogen atoms per base than pyrimidines

### 4. Genome
The genome is an instruction manual for the cell and thus its sequence does not change over the lifetime of the cell
Class 2(4, incorrect) transposons utilize reverse transcriptase
Class 1 transposons utilize an RNA intermediate step unlike Class 2 transposons. (correct)
The genome does not encode any proteins used in organelles such as mitochondria

### 5. Approximate net charge of a Histidine molecule at pH of 11
- -1

### 6. Proline

### 7. Purpose of the increase in 2,3-BPG in red blood cells in adapting to lower atmospheric oxygen levels?
A) to reduce hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, thereby promoting oxygen release to the tissues

### 8. What proportion of the enzyme molecule have bond inL
A) 20%
