Intercalating agents cause covalent modification of certain nucleobases due to pi- stacking

Which amino acid is the most likely to be abundant in histone proteins
Lysine (positively charged)

Purines contain more nitrogen atoms per base than pyrimidines

### 4. Genome
The genome is an instruction manual for the cell and thus its sequence does not change over the lifetime of the cell
Class 2(4, incorrect) transposons utilize reverse transcriptase
Class 1 transposons utilize an RNA intermediate step unlike Class 2 transposons. (correct)
The genome does not encode any proteins used in organelles such as mitochondria

### 5. Approximate net charge of a Histidine molecule at pH of 11
- -1

### 6. Proline

### 7. Purpose of the increase in 2,3-BPG in red blood cells in adapting to lower atmospheric oxygen levels?
A) to reduce hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, thereby promoting oxygen release to the tissues

### 8. What proportion of the enzyme molecule have bond inL
A) 20%


## Lecture 5. Biochemical Energy Generation and Utilization
Types of membrane transporter
### Glucose uptake by intestinal cells 
- (Pancreatic amylase, Apical membrane, Basal membrane, tight junctions, , secondary active. transport)
- Move into the intestinal Epithelium through the SGLT1 Na+/Glucose Symporter
- Move against the electrochemical gradient
- Not using ATP, but harnesses energy in an electrochemical gradient, established by primary transport (Na+/K+ APTase)
- Glucose goes into the bloodstream through the GLUT2 uniporter (passive transport)

### Importance of Concentration Gradients
- Neuron Signaling - Action potential (Ca2+)


### ATP recycling process
- Each ATP molecules must be recycled an average of 500-750 times per day
- Neurons - Action potential muscle contraction, Anabolic Metabolism, Waste Processing and Removal
- Electrons Harvested from food molecules
### How much ATP is there?
- Thought Q1: If there is 0.1 mol of ATP in the body at any one time, how many molecules of ATP are present in the human body? If each of these molecules is recycled 750 times (on a particularly active day), how many chemical reactions take place to regenerate this energy source?
- Q2: If there is 0.1 mole of ATP in the body at any one time and the molar mass of ATP 507.181g/mol, what is the mass in grams of ATP present in the body? (~50 g of ATP)

### Energy Carriers
- Organic molecules that undergo redox reaction to shuttle e-
- NAD+/NADH: Loosely binding cofactor -> can be easily released to transel to another location
- $FAD/\ FADH_2$ : Tight -inding cofactor (prosthetic group)
  ![[Pasted image 20260209100750.png]]
  - $NADP^+/\ NADPH$ : e- carriers get to ithe nner membrane -> proton pumps move H+ against gradient -> Proton channel protein, ATP synthease $ADP + PO_4 \to ATP$
