### Naming Enzymes
- '-ase'
- Can catalyze reverse reaction
- Protease: "-in", 
	- ex) (chymo)trypsin, paptain

### EC Primary Classification
1. Oxidoreductases, Oxidation/Reduction
2. Transferases, Atom/group transfer (excluding other classes)
3. Hydrolases, Hydrolysis
4. Lyases, Group removal (excluding 3)
5. Isomerases, Isomerization
6. Ligases, Joining of molecules linked to the breakage of a pyrophosphate bond

### Oxidoreductases
- Oxidation/Reduction happen together
- Often proton move around electron at the same time
## Transferases

### Hydrolases 
- Reaction involves H2O to join or cleave molecules
- Polymer <-> monomer
### Lyases
- Mediate formation or removal of C=C
- Also called oxidoreductase
### Isomerase
- A single molecule is rearranged
- Glucose-6-phospate -> Fructose-6-phosphate
### Ligases
- Ligation reactions use the energy of ATP to join two molecules together
- ex) Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for methionine
- ex) DNA Ligase: 
	- 1. Enzyme attached to AMP
	- 2. DNA-diphosphate linkage (Transfer of AMP)
	- 3. 3' OH nucleophilic attack, AMP leaves, DNA linked (Nucleophilic attack of the 5' terminus)

## Enzyme Kinetics

### The Catalytic Constant
- $k_{cat}$ = turnover rate or frequency (# of substrates that can be converted into product by one enzyme molecule per time)
- How good is the active site?

### Enzyme-Substrate Binding
- Only small # (~10) residues are involved in the active site
- Rest residues mediate interaction with outside 
- Shapes & Charged properties -> Precise orientation of substrate
- Bind to a single substrate molecule

### Some enzymes need cofactors
- Metal ions / organic molecule
- Holoenzyme (enzyme where cofactor bound)
- ==Apoenzyme==: coenzyme (small organic molecule that can bind & release at certain frequency)
- Apoenzyme-Prosthetic Group (Small organic molecule binds really tightly)
- Apoenzyme-Metal Ion (cofactor)

### Enzyme and Reaction Rate
- S -> P
- Enzyme enhances reaction rate but don't change equalibrium
- $K_{eq}$ = $\frac{Product concentration at end point}{Substrate concentration at end point}$ = 
- E + S $\to$ ES complex $\to$ E + P
- Enzyme reduce the activation energy required for a reaction
- Enzyme Assays
	- p-Nitrophenyl Orthophosphate (colorless) -> p-Nitrophenyl (bright yellow under alkaline conditions) catalyzed by Alkaline Phosphatase
	- Product increase at a rapid rate (constant rate), Over time rate slows down
### Michaelis-Menten Kinetics
$$
initial\ rate\ of\ concentration\ (v_0) = \frac{V_{max} * [S]}{[S] + K_m}
$$
- $K_m$ - Substrate concentration at 1/2 $V_{max}$ - Measures Enzyme Activity

- It an inverse correlation
	- A low KJm
- 1. enzyme with low K_m: probably be saturated with substrate at physiological concentration (constant rate)
- 2. enzyme with high K_m: not saturated, amount of substrate will have big effect on activity -> variate rate of reaction

2. Two enzymes, similar V_max, compare for same substrate K_m can predict relative activity of different pathway
3. How to control rates in different environment in the body 
	- binder/inhibitor expression
	- Splicing (expression level in tissue)
	- mRNA regulation
	- Cofactor
	- pH
