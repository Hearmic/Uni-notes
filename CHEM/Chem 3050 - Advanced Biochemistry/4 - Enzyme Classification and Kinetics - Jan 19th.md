### Naming Enzymes
- '-ase'
- Can catalyze reverse reaction
- Protease: "-in", 
	- ex) (chymo)trypsin, paptain

### EC Primary Classification
1. Oxidoreductases, Oxidation/Reduction
2. Transferases, Atom/group transfer (excluding other classes)
3. Hydrolases, Hydrolysis
4. Lyases, Group removal (excluding 3)
5. Isomerases, Isomerization
6. Ligases, Joining of molecules linked to the breakage of a pyrophosphate bond

### Oxidoreductases
- Oxidation/Reduction happen together
- Often proton move around electron at the same time
## Transferases

### Hydrolases 
- Reaction involves H2O to join or cleave molecules
- Polymer <-> monomer
### Lyases
- Mediate formation or removal of C=C
- Also called oxidoreductase
### Isomerase
- A single molecule is rearranged
- Glucose-6-phospate -> Fructose-6-phosphate
### Ligases
- Ligation reactions use the energy of ATP to join two molecules together
- ex) Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for methionine
- ex) DNA Ligase: 
	- 1. Enzyme attached to AMP
	- 2. DNA
