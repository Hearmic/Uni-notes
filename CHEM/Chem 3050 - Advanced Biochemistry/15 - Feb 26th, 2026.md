### Lecture 7 - Krebs Cycle

### Pyruvate Oxidation
- Coenzyme A is a substrate
- Coenzyme A is also commonly used as a substrate/intermediate in reactions
- CoASH
- Using the thiol functional group, commonly forms 
- Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH) Complex
	- multienzyme complex (E1, E2, and E3)
	- Tethered by flexible arms -> move around substrate
	- Uses several cofactors
		- Thiamine pyrophosphate
		- Lipoamide
		- FAD
		- NAD+

	- Blue part (lipoamide cofactor)

	- Thiamine Pyrophosphate (TPP)

	- Anionic C1 carbon attacks the ketone carbonyl
	- Decarboxylation thiozolium ring

#### Decarboxylation occurs at E1
- The oxidized form of diphosphate enters E1
- Double bond attacks disulfide bond
- Release TPP
- New lipoamide loaded with acctyl
