### Lecture 7 - Krebs Cycle

### Pyruvate Oxidation
- Coenzyme A is a substrate
- Coenzyme A is also commonly used as a substrate/intermediate in reactions
- CoASH
- Using the thiol functional group, commonly forms 
- Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH) Complex
	- multienzyme complex (E1, E2, and E3)
	- Tethered by flexible arms -> move around substrate
