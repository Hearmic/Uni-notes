### Proteins are made of $\alpha$-Amino Acids

20 Major Amino Acids
Two major categories based on R-groups:
- Nonpolar (Hydrophobic Amino acids)
	- Aliphatic Amino Acids (Branched Chain)
	- Aromatic Amino Acids (contain a phenyl Ring)
	- Met and Pro
- Polar 
	- Polar Uncharged (can carry )
	- Acidic Amino Acids (carry positive charge)
	- Basic Amino Acids (carry negative charge)
#### Aliphatic Amino Acids
 - 

#### Aromatic
- Phe F
- Tyr, Y
- Trp, W
#### Special
- Proline (Pro, P): Ring Structure, Destabilizes 2nd structure
- Methionine (Met, M)
#### Polar Uncharged Amino Acids
Carry Permanant Dipole
- Cysteine (Cys, C)
- Serine (Ser, S)
- Threonine (Thr, T)
- Asparagine (Asn, N)
- Glutamine (Gln, Q)
#### Polar Acidic Acids
- Aspartic Acid (Asp, D)
- Glutamic Acid (Glu, E)
#### Polar Basic Amino Acids
Potential to be a positive charge
- Arginine (Arg, R)
- Lysine (Lys, K)
- Histidine (His, H)

### Chirality, Zwitterions:
$\alpha$-Amino Acids are Chiral
L-Alanine (Natural) vs D-Alanine
- Correspond to the R and S configuration

Amino Acids are ==Zwitterions==:
- A molecule having two or more functional groups, both positive and negative, but a neutral net charge at a specific pH (Isoelectric point)

### Isoelectric Points (pl's) and $pK_a$'s
- The isoelectric point of a molecule or a protein can be determined by evaluating all of the acid dissociation constants (pKa values) for functional groups that can carry charges within the molecule
- The pKa value indicates the strength of an acid (or the ability of a functional group to donate a proton to the surrounding medium)
- The lower the $pK_a$, the stronger the acid

$pK_a$ can shift depending on the environment

The peptide bond is an Amide

- Directionality of peptide bond synthesis (ribosomal)
  N-terminus: starting point
  C-terminus: elongated through a peptide bond
- R groups are bulky, reducing sterics by making a trans conformation (except Proline which prefer to have cis- conformation, useful for bending peptide structure)
- The amide bond is planar

### Level of Structures
#### Primary
- 1D

#### Secondary 
Favorable $p_{hi}$ or $p_{si}$ angle
Local structure
R group not involved with H-bonding but affects bkrics
- $\alpha$-Helix: 
	- The core of the helix is tightly packed
	- more compact than the fully extended polypeptide chain, with phi/psi angles of 180 degrees
	- The average number of amino acids in a helix is 11, which gives 3 turns) 
	- The Left-handed helix is rare
	- The R-groups face outside of the helix
	- influence folding
		- hydrophobic - fold inside the protein shielded, span plasma membrane
		- Hydrophilic - spans in a water environment
	- Some amino acid side chains DO NOT favor alpha helical structure
	     Competes for H-bond backbone & destabilizing $a$-helices
	  .       Not a black and white statement
		- Glycine (Gly, G) -> too small, flexible
		- Valine (Val, V) $\to$ Early branching residues, dstabilized by the sterically bulky side chain
		- Isoleucine (Ile, I) $\to$ Early branching residues, dstabilized by the sterically bulky side chain
		- Serine (Ser, S) $\to$Too much polarity (H-bond)
		- Asparagine (Asn, N) $\to$Too much polarity (H-bond)
		- Aspartic Acid (Asp, D) $\to$Too much polarity (H-bond)
		- Proline (Pro, P) -> too rigid, cis conformation, causes bends
		
- $\beta$-sheet
	- H-bond between backbone
	- R-groups - above, below folds
	- Antiparallel conformation is stronger

- Beta Turns and Other Secondary Structure
- $\beta$-turn Type 1: Pro common in position 2 + anything in position 3
- $\beta$-turn Type 2: Requires glycine in position 3
	![[Pasted image 20260112094851.png]]
- Supersecondary Structure
	- $\beta$-Hairpin
	- Helix turn Helix
	- $\alpha$-$\alpha$ Corner (common in myoglobin)
- Protein Motifs: formed by combined secondary and supersecondary structures
- $\beta$-strand has a tendency to twist in the right-hand direction
- Lead to twisted sheets, saddles & $\beta$-barrels
- The Rossman Fold
	- Some motifs serve a particular function (ex: binding to substrate or cofactors)
- Tim Barrel
	- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ protein fold - alternating
	- Solenoid (donut shape)
	- Many sequences can form it
	- 15 different protein families (conversion evolution)
  
#### Tertiary
3D shape of protein
- Ionic
- van der Waals
- Dipole-Diple
- Hydrophobic effect
- Disulfide Bridges (two Cystine residues, not spontaneous, enzyme required)
#### Quaternary
- Insulin forms a quaternary protein structure
- Inactive hexameric structure provides a way to store the insulin hormone prior to release
- Insulin hexamer is for storing
	- Stabled inactive conformation
	- Available for release
	- Reactivate in the dimer form

### Fibrous Proteins

#### Keratin
- Characterized by elongated protein structures. These types of proteins often aggregate 
- $\alpha$-Keratin: Occurs in mammals (hair, nail, horns)
- $\beta$-Keratin: Occurs in birds and reptiles
- Humans have more than 50 keratin genes that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.
- Keratin tissue comes from cells, it's filled with keratin

##### Coiled Coil Repeats
- Type 1 - Acidic Keratin
- Type 2 - Basic Keratin
- Type 1 and 2 form a dimer (by ionic interaction)

- a-helical region in monomer
- coiled coil dimer
- staggered tetramer of two coil-coil dimers
- Two tetramers packed together
Eight tetramers twisted into a ropelike filament
Hydrophobic Interaction along $\alpha$-helical segment

#### Collagen
- Tendon, Ligament
- Most abundant 25%-35% of the animal body
- Type 1: 
	- Glycine occurs every 3rd residue
	- Proline 17% with post-translational modification: 4-Hydroxyprolyl residue (Hyp), 3-Hydroxyprolyl residue, 5-Hydroxylysyl residue (Hyl)
	- Nearly one-third of its residues are glycine; another 15 to 30% of its residues are proline and 4-hydroxyprolyl (Hyp).
	- 3-Hydroxyprolyl and (4 or) 5-hydroxylysyl (Hyl) residues alsooccur in collagen, but in smaller amounts
	- Prolyl Residue -> Hydroxyprolyl Residue, Lysyl Residue -> Hydroxylysyl Residue (byreaction alpha-ketoglutarate -> succinate, Ascorbate as a cofactor)
	- Glycosylation
- Collagen Synthesis
	- Synthesis of a polypeptide by the ribosome attached to the ER
	- Release of collagen fiber into ER Lumen -> Procollagen
	- Hydroxylation, Glycosylation
	- Assembly of Triple Helix - Every 3rd residue of each chain passes through the center of the triple helix -> only Glycine can fit
	- Secretion through the Golgi and Transport Vesicles
	- Extracellular Matrix - Cleavage of Propeptides (Tropocollagen) -> Assembly of Collagen Fibril -> Crosslinking and Hydrogen Bonding -> Collagen Fiber
- Collagen Crosslinking
	- Not a disulfide bond (almost no Cys in collagen)
	- Long names: 
		- dehydro- hydroxy- lysinonorleucine (DeH-HLNL)
		- histidino- hydroxy- lysinonorleucine (HHL)
		- histidino- hydroxy- merodesmosine (HHMD)
	- Tend to happen near N/C termini
	- The degree of crosslinking in tissue increases with age (meat from older meat is tougher)
### Globular Proteins
- Spheroproteins (roughly spherical shape)
- Water soluble
- Enzymes that catalyze organic reactions taking place in the organism in mild conditions and with great specificity. Different esterases fulfill this role.
- Messengers, by transmitting messages to regulate biological processes. This function is done by hormones, i.e. insulin etc
- Transporters of other molecules through membranes
- Regulatory roles are also performed by globular proteins rather than fibrous proteins
- Structural support

### Integral Membrane Protein
- Integral bitropic (cross-membrane on both sides) and polytropic (many times) proteins 
- Integral monotropic proteins (attached to only one side of the membrane)
	- 1. amphipathic $\alpha$-helix
	- 2. hydrophobic loops
	- 3. Covalent bond linkage (lipidation)
	- 4. Electrostatic or ionic interaction with lipids
- Dissociate by detergents

### Peripheral Membrane Protein
- Temporally attached to lipids or integral proteins by hydrophobic/electrostatic (non-covalent)
- Dissociate by polar reagents (high salt, pH) (easier than integral proteins)

### Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP)
- often adopt a specific secondary or tertiary structure when they bind to other molecules, such as ions, organic molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids.
- Lacks fixed structure -> flexibility allows different conformation
- Important in cell signaling, transcription, and chromatin remodeling

### Protein Folding
- Hydrophobic Collapse (maximize hydrophilic/hydrophobic residues close to/away from the water environment)
- Water Clathrates - water forms a rigid shell around the hydrophobic group, with an ordered arrangement of $H_2O$ $\to$ entropy decrease
