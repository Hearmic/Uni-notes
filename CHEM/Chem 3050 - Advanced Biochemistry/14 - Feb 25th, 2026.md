### Glyceraldehyde -3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase
- Oxygen from Pi, nucleophilic attack on carbonyl -> Thiol leaving group
- 1,3 Bisphosphoglycerate
- Phosphorylated with coupled reaction, reduction of NAD+

### Step 7
- 1,3 Bisphosphoglycerate -> 3-Phosphoglycerate (catalyzed by 3-Phosphate Kinase, with $Mg^{2+}$)
- ADP -> ATP
### Step 9
- Enolase (Lyase, Involves C=C bond)
  Stabilize - charge
- 1. Lys deprotonate alpha Hydrogen
- 2. Hydroxide elimination

#### Enolase can be used Diagnostically
- Testing for Enolase in cerebrospinal fluid
- The fastest rate of tumor growth occurred in patients with the higheest levels of CSF Enolase
- High Enolase correlated with cancer
