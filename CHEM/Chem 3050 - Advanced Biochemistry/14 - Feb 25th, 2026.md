### Glyceraldehyde -3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase
- Oxygen from Pi, nucleophilic attack on carbonyl -> Thiol leaving group
- 1,3 Bisphosphoglycerate
- Phosphorylated with coupled reaction, reduction of NAD+

### Step 7
- 1,3 Bisphosphoglycerate -> 3-Phosphoglycerate (catalyzed by 3-Phosphate Kinase, with $Mg^{2+}$)
- ADP -> ATP
