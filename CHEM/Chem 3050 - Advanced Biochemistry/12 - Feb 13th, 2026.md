### Isozymes of Hexokinase (different genes & same function)
- Hexokinase I
- Hexokinase II
- Hexokinase III
- Hexokinase IV (also called Glucokinase)
  
- Make it possible for different organs/systems to regulate glucose-mediated processes differently.
- Different kinetics ($k_{cat}$ and/or $K_M$), PTM, allosteric effectors
- All hexokinases can use multiple hexoses: Galactose, mannose, modified glucose

### Glucose-6-phosphate
- Glycogen -> Glucose-1-phosphate -> Glucose-6-phosphate
- -> Pentose phosphate pathway (most cells) -> Ribose + NADPH
- -> Hexosamine Biosynthesis (proteoglycan + glycoprotein formation)
- -> Glycolysis (most cells esp. muscle and brain)
-  -> G6P = sensor for insulin release (pancreas) & glucagon
-  -> Glucose (liver) -> T_0 blood stream (homeostasis, blood sugar level)
-  -> Pyruvate -> Lactate (anaerobic), $CO_2$ and $H_2O$ (aerobic)

### Hexokinase I
- Primarily in the brain and Red Blood Cells
- Low $K_m$ and is inhibited by the product, G6P (beneficial for not wasting time/energy making more than needed)
- Negative feedback inhibition is overcome by low levels of inorganic phosphate
- In the brain: Localized to mitochondria (helps couple Krebs cycle)
- In Red Blood Cell (floating freely in cytosol)

### Hexokinase II
- Primarily in Akeletal Muscle, Hear Muscle, and Adipose tissue (insulin-sensitive tissues)
- Low $K_M$ or high activity when low
