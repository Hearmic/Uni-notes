### Isozymes of Hexokinase (different genes & same function)
- Hexokinase I
- Hexokinase II
- Hexokinase III
- Hexokinase IV (also called Glucokinase)
  
- Make it possible for different organs/systems to regulate glucose-mediated processes differently.
- Different kinetics ($k_{cat}$ and/or $K_M$), PTM, allosteric effectors
- All hexokinases can use multiple hexoses: Galactose, mannose, modified glucose

### Glucose-6-phosphate
