Chemical Kinetics: Study of chemical change in time

- How to calculate the concentration of reactants and products at different times during a reaction
- How to use the information on reaction kinetics to understand the molecular steps involved in a reaction (reaction mechanism)
- How temperature affects the rate of chemical reaction
- How chemical reactions can be accelerated by special substances called catalysts
### The Rate of a Chemical Reaction
The rate of change of reactants is negative, as their concentration is decreasing
Unit: M/L*s = M/s

Why is there a "1/2" in front of the second quotient?
Stoichiometry form 2 moles HI -> 1/2 in rate

$$
aA + bB \to cC + dD
$$

$$
\textit{rate} = - \frac{1}{a}\frac{\Delta[A]}{\Delta t} = - \frac{1}{b}\frac{\Delta[B]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{c}\frac{\Delta[C]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{d}\frac{\Delta[D]}{\Delta t}
$$
- Reaction rate can be expressed using any reactant or product
- Reaction rate is always positive
- The value of reaction rate is independent of which reactant or product was used in the calculation
- Rate of consumption or formation of individual components can be easily calculated from the reaction rate value


Average rate of reaction in 10 seconds
$$
rate = -\frac{1}{3}\frac{0.868 M - 1 M}{10sec} = 4.40*10^{-3} M/s
$$

The rate of change in the concentration of $H^+$

$$
rate = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\Delta [H^+]}{\Delta t} \to -2* rate = \frac{\Delta [H^+]}{\Delta t} = -2 * 4.40*10^{-3} M/s = 8.80*10^{-3}M/s
$$
The average rate of a reaction depends on the width of the chosen time interval ($\Delta$t) - Problematic
Solution: calculate the slope of the tangent to the concentration curve at a given time point. This slope gives the instantaneous reaction rate.

Rate Law: The effect of Concentration on Reaction Rate
The mathmatical relationship between the rate of reaction and the concentrations of reactant is called the rate raw.
$$
Rate = k[A]^n
$$
k is rate constant, n is reaction order with respect to A

- n can only be determined by conducting an experiment
- Typically, n is a small integer, but can be fractional or negative

Zero-Order Reaction:
- If a reaction is zero order, the rate of the reaction is always the same. Doubling \[A\]  will have no effect on the reaction rate 
First-Order Reaction:
- If a reaction is first order, the rate is directly proportional to the reactant concentration. Doubling \[A] will double the rate of the reaction
