Chemical Kinetics: Study of chemical change in time

- How to calculate the concentration of reactants and products at different times during a reaction
- How to use the information on reaction kinetics to understand the molecular steps involved in a reaction (reaction mechanism)
- How temperature affects the rate of chemical reaction
- How chemical reactions can be accelerated by special substances called catalysts
### The Rate of a Chemical Reaction
The rate of change of reactants is negative, as their concentration is decreasing
Unit: M/L*s = M/s

Why is there a "1/2" in front of the second quotient?
Stoichiometry form 2 moles HI -> 1/2 in rate
